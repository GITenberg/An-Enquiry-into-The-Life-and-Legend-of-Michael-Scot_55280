<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>After some considerable time spent in making
collections for the work which is now submitted to
the public, I became aware that a biography of
Michael Scot was in existence which had been
composed as early as the close of the sixteenth
century. This is the work of Bernardino Baldi
of Urbino, who was born in 1553. He studied
medicine at Padua, but soon turned his attention
to mathematics, especially to the historical developments
of that science. Taking holy orders,
he became Abbot of Guastalla in 1586, and in the
quiet of that cloister found time to produce his
work ‘De le vite de Matematici’ of which the
biography of Scot forms a part. He died in
1617.</p>

<p>This discovery led me at first to think that my
original plan might with some advantage be
modified. Baldi had evidently enjoyed great
advantages in writing his life of Scot. His time
lay nearer to that of Scot by three hundred years
than our own does. He was a native of Italy,
where so large a part of Scot’s life was passed.
He had studied at Padua, the last of the great
schools in which Averroës, whom Scot first introduced
to the Latins, still held intellectual sway.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
All this seemed to indicate him as one who was
exceptionally situated and suited for the work of
collecting such accounts of Michael Scot as still
survived in the south when he lived and wrote.
The purpose he had in view was also such as
promised a serious biography, not entirely, nor even
chiefly, occupied with the recitation of traditional
tales, but devoted to a solid account of the philosopher’s
scientific fame in what was certainly one
of the most considerable branches of science which
he followed. It occurred to me therefore that an
edition of Baldi’s life of Scot, which has never yet
been printed, might give scope for annotations and
digressions embodying all the additional material
I had in hand or might still collect, and that a
work on this plan would perhaps best answer the
end in view.</p>

<p>A serious difficulty, however, here presented
itself, and in the end proved insuperable, as I was
quite unable to gain access to the work of Baldi.
It seems to exist in no more than two manuscripts,
both of them belonging to a private library in
Rome, that of the late Prince Baldassare Boncompagni,
who had acquired them from the Albani
collection. The Boncompagni library has been now
for some time under strict seal, pending certain
legal proceedings, and all my endeavours to get
even a sight of the manuscripts were in vain. In
these circumstances I fell back upon a printed
volume, the <cite>Cronica de Matematici overo Epitome
dell’Istoria delle vite loro</cite>, which is an abbreviated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
form of Baldi’s work and was published at Urbino
in 1707. The account of Michael Scot which it
gives is not such as to increase my regret that I
cannot present this biography to the reader in its
most complete form. Thus it runs: ‘Michele
Scoto, that is Michael the Scot, was a Judicial
Astrologer, in which profession he served the
Emperor Frederick <span class="smcapuc">II</span>. He wrote a most learned
treatise by way of questions upon the <cite>Sphere</cite> of
John de Sacrobosco which is still in common use.
Some say he was a Magician, and tell how he used
to cause fetch on occasion, by magic art, from the
kitchen of great Princes whatever he needed for his
table. He died from the blow of a stone falling on
his head, having already foreseen that such would be
the manner of his end.’ Now Scot’s additions to the
<cite>Sphere</cite> of Sacrobosco are among the more common
of his printed works, while the tales of his feasts
at Bologna, and of his sudden death, are repeated
almost <i lang="la">ad nauseam</i> by almost every early writer
who has undertaken to illustrate the text of Dante.
So far as we can tell, therefore, Baldi would seem to
have made no independent research on his own
account regarding Scot’s life and literary labours,
but to have depended entirely upon very obvious
and commonplace printed authorities. To crown
all, he assigns 1240 as the <i lang="la">floruit</i> of Michael Scot,
a date at least five years posterior to that of
his death! On the whole then there is little cause
to regret that his work on this subject is not more
fully accessible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span></p>

<p>My study of the life and times of Scot thus
resumed its natural tendency towards an independent
form, there being no text known to me
that could in any way supply the want of an
original biography. It is for the reader to judge
how far the boldness of such an attempt has been
justified by its success. The difficulties of the
task have certainly been increased by the want of
any previous collections that could be called satisfactory.
Boece, Dempster, and Naudé yield little
in the way of precise and instructive detail; their
accounts of Scot fall to be classed with that of
Baldi as partly incorrect and partly commonplace.
Schmuzer alone seems by the title of his work<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
to promise something more original. Unfortunately
my attempts to obtain it have been defeated by the
great rarity of the volume, which is not to be found
in any of the libraries to which I have access.</p>

<p>This failure in the department of biography
already formed has obliged me to a more exact and
extensive study of original manuscript sources for
the life of Scot than I might otherwise have thought
necessary, and has proved thus perhaps rather of
advantage. It is inevitable indeed that a work of
this kind, undertaken several ages too late, should
be comparatively barren in those dates and intimate
details which are so satisfactory to our curiosity
when we can fall upon them. In the absence of
these, however, our attention is naturally fixed,
and not, as it seems to me, unprofitably, on what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
is after all of higher or more enduring importance.
The mind is free to take a wider range, and in
place of losing itself in the lesser facts of an
individual life, studies the intellectual movements
and gauges the progress of what was
certainly a remarkable epoch in philosophy, science,
and literature. The almost exact reproduction in
Spain during the thirteenth century of the Alexandrian
school of thought and science and even
superstition; the part played by the Arab race
in this curious transference, and the close relation
it holds to our modern intellectual life—if the
volume now published be found to throw light
on subjects so little understood, yet so worthy of
study, I shall feel more than rewarded for the pains
and care spent in its preparation.</p>

<p>In the course of researches among the libraries
of Scotland and Italy, of England and France, of
Spain and Germany, I have received much kindness
from the learned men who direct these institutions.
I therefore gladly avail myself of this opportunity to
express my thanks in general to all those who have
so kindly come to my help, and in particular to
Signor Comm. G. Biagi, and Signor Prof. E.
Rostagno of the Laurentian Library; to Signore
L. Licini of the Riccardian Library; to the Rev.
Padre Ehrle of the Vatican Library; to Signor
Cav. Giorgi, and the Conte Passerini of the Casanatense;
to Signor Prof. Menghini of the Vittorio
Emanuele Library, Rome; and to Signor Comm.
Cugnoni of the Chigi Library. I am also much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
indebted to the kindness of Professor R. Foerster
of Breslau; of Mr. W. M. Lindsay, Fellow of
Jesus College, Oxford, and the Rev. R. Langton
Douglas of New College, who have furnished me
with valuable notes from the libraries of that university,
and, not least of all, to the interest taken
in my work by Mr. Charles Godfrey Leland, who
has been good enough to read it in manuscript,
and to favour me with curious material and valuable
suggestions.</p>

<p>If the result of my studies should prove somewhat
disappointing to the reader, I can but plead
the excuse with which Pliny furnishes me, it is
one having peculiar application to such a task as is
here attempted: ‘Res ardua,’ he says, ‘vetustis novitatem
dare, novis auctoritatem, obsoletis nitorem,
obscuris lucem, fastiditis gratiam, dubiis fidem,
omnibus vero naturam, et naturae suae omnia.’</p>

<span class="smaller">BIRTHPLACE AND EARLY STUDIES OF MICHAEL SCOT</span></h2>

<p>In the Borders of Scotland it is well known that
any piece of hill pasture, if it be fenced in but for a
little from the constant cropping of the sheep, will
soon show springing shoots of forest trees indigenous
to the soil, whose roots remain wherever
the plough has not passed too deeply. Centuries
ago, when nature had her way and was unrestrained,
the whole south-eastern part of the country was
covered with dense forests and filled with forest-dwellers;
the wild creatures that form the prey of
the snare and the quarry of the chase. In the deep
valleys, and by the streams of Tweed and Teviot,
and many another river of that well-watered land,
stood the great ranks and masses of the oak and
beech as captains and patriarchs of the forest,
mingled with the humbler whitethorn which made a
dense undergrowth wherever the sun could reach.
On the heights grew the sombre firs; their gnarled
and ruddy branches crowned with masses of bluish-green
foliage, while the alders followed the water-courses,
and, aided by the shelter of these secret
valleys, all but reached the last summits of the hills,
which alone, in many a varied slope and peak and
swelling breast, rose eminent and commanding over
these dark and almost unbroken woodlands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>Such was south-eastern Scotland in the twelfth
century: a country fitted to be the home of men
of action rather than of thought; men whose joy
should lie in the chase and the conflict with nature
as yet unsubdued, who could track the savage
creatures of the forest to their dens, and clear the
land where it pleased them, and build, and dwell,
and beget children in their own likeness, till by the
labours of generations that country should become
pastoral, peaceful, and fit for fertile tillage as we
see it now.</p>

<p>Already, at the early time of which we speak,
something of this work had been begun. There
were gaps in the high forest where it lay well to
the sun: little clearings marked by the ridge and
furrow of a rude agriculture. Here and there a
baron’s lonely tower raised its grey horn on high,
sheltering a troop of men-at-arms who made it
their business to guard the land in war, and in
peace to rid it of the savage forest-creatures that
hindered the hind and herd in their labour and
their hope. In the main valleys more than one
great monastery was rising, or already built, by the
waters of Tweed and Teviot. The inmates of these
religious houses took their share in the whole duty
of peaceful Scottish men by following trades at
home or superintending the labours of an army of
hinds who broke in and made profitable the wide
abbey lands scattered here and there over many a
lowland county. All was energy, action, and progress:
a form of life which left but little room for
the enterprises of the mind, the conflicts and conquests
which can alone be known and won in the
world of thought within.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>These conditions we know to have reared and
trained generations of men well fitted to follow
the pursuits of hardy and active life, yet they
cannot have been so constraining as to hinder
the birth of some at least who possessed an altogether
different temper of mind and body. The
lowland Scots were even then of a mixed race:
the ancestry which tends more than any other to
the production of life-eddies, where thought rather
than activity naturally forms and dwells, while the
current of the main stream sweeps past in its
ordinary course. Grant the appearance of such
natures here and there in these early times, and it
is easy to see much in the only life then possible
that was fit to foster their natural tendencies.
The deep woodlands were not only scenes of labour
where sturdy arms found constant employment,
they were homes of mystery in which the young
imagination loved to dwell; peopling them with
half-human shapes more graceful than their
stateliest trees, and half-brutal monsters more
terrible than the fiercest wolf or bear. The
distant sun and stars were more than a heavenly
horologe set to mark the hours for labour or vigil,
they were an unexplored scene of wonder which
patient and brooding thought alone could reach and
interpret. The trivial flight and annual return of
birds, tracing like the wild geese a mysterious wedge
against the sky of winter, gave more than a signal
for the chase, which was all that ordinary men saw
in it. To these finer natures it brought the awakening
which those know who have learned to ask the
mighty questions—Why? Whence? and Whither?
demands which will not be denied till they have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
touched the heights and fathomed the depths of
human life itself. <cite>Our life is a bird</cite>, said one in
these early ages, <cite>which flies by night, and, entering
lighted hall at one end, swiftly passeth out at the
other. So come we, who knoweth whence, and so pass
we, who knoweth whither? From the darkness we
come and to the darkness we go, and the brief light
that is meanwhile ours cannot make the mystery
plain.</cite></p>

<p>But though the nature of this primitive life in
early Scottish days could not hinder the appearance
of men of thought, and even helped their development
as soon as they began to show the movements
of active intellect, yet on the other hand Scotland
had not reached that culture which affords such
natures their due and full opportunity. Centuries
were yet to pass before the foundation of St.
Andrews as the first Scottish university. The
grammar-schools of the country<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> were but a step to
the studies of some foreign seat of learning. The
churchmen who filled considerable positions at
home were either Italians, or had at least been
trained abroad, so that everything in those days
pointed to that path of foreign study which has
since been trodden by so many generations of
Scottish students. The bright example of Scotus
Erigena, who had reached such a high place in
France under Charles the Bald, was an incitement
to the northern world of letters. Young men of
parts and promise naturally sought their opportunity
to go abroad in the hope of finding like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
honourable employment, or, better still, of returning
crowned with the honours of the schools to
occupy some distinguished ecclesiastical position in
their native country.</p>

<p>This then was the age, and these were the
prevailing conditions, under which Michael Scot
was born. To the necessary and common impulse
of Scottish scholars we are to trace the disposition
of the great lines on which his life ran its remarkable
and distinguished course. He is certainly one of
the most notable, as he is among the earliest,
examples of the student Scot abroad.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt regarding the nation
where he had his birth. Disregarding for a moment
the varying accounts of those who lived centuries
after the age of Scot himself, let us make a commencement
with one whose testimony is of the very
highest value, being that of a contemporary. Roger
Bacon, the famous scientist of the thirteenth century,
introduces the name of Michael Scot in the
following manner: ‘Unde, cum per Gerardum
Cremonensem, et Michaelem Scotum, et Aluredum
Anglicum, et Heremannum (Alemannum), et Willielmum
Flemingum, data sit nobis copia translationum
de omni scientia.’<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> In this passage the
distinctive appellation of each author is plainly
derived from that of his native country. That
Bacon believed Michael to be of Scottish descent is
therefore certain, and his opinion is all the more
valuable since he was an Englishman, and not likely
therefore to have confused the two nations of Great
Britain as a foreigner might haply have done. To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
the same purpose is the testimony of Guido Bonatti,
the astrologer, who also belonged to the age of
Bacon and Scot. ‘Illi autem,’ he says,<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> ‘qui fuerunt
in tempore meo, sicut fuit Hugo ab Alugant, Beneguardinus
Davidbam, Joannes Papiensis, Dominicus
Hispanus, Michael Scotus, Stephanus Francigena,
Girardus de Sabloneta Cremonensis, et multi alii.’
Here also the significance of <em>Scotus</em>, as indicating
nationality, is one that hardly admits of question.
It was in all probability on these or similar
authorities that Dempster relied when he said of
Michael:<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> ‘The name Scot, however, is not a
family one, but national,’ though he seems to have
pressed the matter rather too far, it being plainly
possible that <em>Scotus</em> might combine in itself both
significations. In Scotland it might indicate that
Michael belonged to the clan of Scott, as indeed has
been generally supposed, while as employed by men
of other nations, it might declare what they believed
to have been this scholar’s native land.</p>

<p>At this point, however, a new difficulty suggests
itself. It is well known that the lowland Scots
were emigrants from the north of Ireland, and that
in early times <em>Scotus</em> was used as a racial rather
than a local designation. May not Michael have
been an Irishman? Such is the question actually
put by a recent writer,<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and certainly it deserves a
serious answer. We may commence by remarking
that even on this understanding of it the name is
an indefinite one as regards locality, and might
therefore have been applied to one born in Scotland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
just as well as if he had first seen the light in the
sister isle. So certainly is this the case that when
we recall the name of John Scotus we find it was
customary to add the appellative <em>Erigena</em> to determine
his birthplace. At that time the separation
of race was much less marked than it had become
in Michael’s day, and it seems certain therefore
that if <em>Michael Scotus</em> was thought a sufficient
designation of the man by Bacon and Bonatti, they
must have used it in the sense of indicating that he
came of that part of the common stock which had
crossed the sea and made their home in Scotland.
But to find a conclusive answer to this difficulty we
need only anticipate a little the course of our
narrative by mentioning here a highly curious fact
which will occupy our attention in its proper place.
When Michael Scot was offered high ecclesiastical
preferment in Ireland he declined it on the ground
that he was ignorant of the vernacular tongue of
that country.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> This seems to supply anything that
may have been wanting in the other arguments we
have advanced, and the effect of the whole should
be to assure our conviction that there need be now
no further attempt made to deny Scotland the
honour of having been the native land of so distinguished
a scholar.</p>

<p>Nor are we altogether without the means of
coming to what seems at least a probable conclusion
regarding the very district of the Scottish lowlands
where Michael Scot was born. Leland the antiquary
tells us that he was informed on good authority
that Scot came from the territory of Durham.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
Taken literally this statement would make him an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
Englishman, but no one would think of quoting it
as of sufficient value to disprove the testimony of
Bacon and Bonatti who both believed Michael to
have been born in Scotland. If, however, there
should offer itself any way in which both these
apparently contending opinions can be reconciled,
we are surely bound to accept such an explanation
of the difficulty, and in fact the solution we are
about to propose not only meets the conditions of
the problem, but will be found to narrow very
considerably the limits of country within which the
birthplace of Scot is to be looked for.</p>

<p>The See of Durham in that age, and for long
afterwards, had a wide sphere of influence, extending
over much of the south-eastern part of the Scottish
Borders. Many deeds relating to this region of
Scotland must be sought in the archives that belong
to the English Cathedral. To be born in the
territory of Durham then, as Leland says Scot had
been, was not necessarily to be a native of England,
and the anonymous Florentine commentator on
Dante uses a remarkable expression which seems to
confirm this solution as far as Scot is concerned.
‘This Michael,’ he says, ‘was of the Province of
Scotland’;<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and his words seem to point to that
part of the Scottish lowlands adjacent to the See
of Durham and in a sense its <em>province</em>, as subject to
its influence, just as Provence, the analogous part
of France, had its name from the similar relation
it bore to Rome. The most likely opinion therefore
that can now be formed on the subject leads
us to believe that Scot was born somewhere in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
valley of the Tweed; if we understand that geographical
expression in the wide sense which makes
it equivalent to the whole of the south-eastern
borders of Scotland.</p>

<p>Nor is this so contrary as might at first appear
to the tradition which makes Scot a descendant of
the family of Balwearie in Fife. Hector Boëce,
Principal of Marischal College, Aberdeen, who first
gave currency to the story,<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> could hardly have
meant to imply that Michael was actually born at
Balwearie. It is to be presumed that he understood
<em>Scotus</em> to have been a family name; and the Scotts,
who became of Balwearie by marriage with the
heiress of that estate, did not enter into possession
of it till long after the close of the twelfth century.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
To call Michael a son of Balwearie in the genealogical
sense, however, is in perfect agreement with the
conclusion regarding his origin which we have
just reached; for the original home of the Scotts
who afterwards held that famous property as their
<i lang="fr">chef lieu</i>, lay by the upper streams of Tweed in the
very district which every probability has already
indicated to us as that of Michael’s birthplace. In
1265 we find an entry of money paid by the Crown
‘to Michael Scot and Richard Rufus who have
occupied the waste lands at Stuth,’ near Peebles.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
Identification is here out of the question, as Michael
the scholar, of whom we write, was by this time
long in his grave, but the entry we have quoted
shows that a family of this surname, who still used
the Christian name of Michael, was flourishing in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
this part of Scotland during the second half of the
thirteenth century.</p>

<p>It is to be remarked, too, that the Scottish tales
of wonder relating to Michael Scot have a local
colour that accords well with the other signs
we have noticed. The hill which the sorcerer’s
familiar spirit cleaves in sunder is the triple peak of
Eildon; the water which he curbs is that of Tweed;
from Oakwood he rides forth to try the witch of
Falsehope, and in Oakwood tower may still be seen
the <em>Jingler’s room</em>: a curious anachronism, for
Oakwood is a building much more recent than the
days of Michael Scot, yet one which fixes for us in
a picturesque and memorable way the district of
country where, according to the greatest number of
converging probabilities, this remarkable man was
born.</p>

<p>As to the date of his birth, it is difficult to be
very precise. The probability that he died suddenly,
and before he had completed the measure of
an ordinary lifetime, prevents us from founding our
calculations upon the date of his decease, which can
be pretty accurately determined. A more certain
argument may be derived from the fact that Scot had
finished his youthful studies, made some figure in the
world, and entered on the great occupation of his life
as an author, as early as the year 1210.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Assuming
then that thirty was the least age he could well
have attained at the period in question, the year
1180 would be indicated as that of his birth, or rather
as the latest date to which it can with probability be
referred; 1175 being in every way a more likely
approximation to the actual time of this event.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>It is unfortunate that we find ourselves in the
same position with regard to the interesting question
of Scot’s early education, having only the
suggestions derived from probable conjecture to
offer on this subject also. Du Boulay indeed, in
his account of the University of Paris,<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> pretends
to supply a pretty complete account of the schools
which Scot attended, but, as he adds that this
was the usual course of study in those days, we
find reason to think that he may have been guided
in his assertions, rather by the probabilities of the
case, than by any exact evidence. Nor is it likely
that any more satisfactory assurance can now be
had on this point: the time being too remote and
the want of early material for Scot’s biography
defeating in this respect all the care and attention
that can now be given to the subject.</p>

<p>We know, however, that there was a somewhat
famous grammar-school at Roxburgh in the twelfth
century,<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> and considering the rarity of such an
opportunity at so early a period, and the proximity
of this place to the district in which Scot was born,
we may venture to fancy that here he may have
learned his rudiments, thus laying the foundation of
those deeper studies, which he afterwards carried
to such a height.</p>

<p>With regard to Durham, the matter may be considered
to stand on firmer ground. The name of
Michael Scot, as we have already seen, has for many
ages been associated with this ancient Cathedral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
city by the Wear. If the question of his birthplace
be regarded as now determined in favour of Scotland,
no reason remains for this association so convincing
as that which would derive it from the fact
that he pursued his education there. The Cathedral
School of Durham was a famous one, which no
doubt exerted a strong attraction upon studious
youths throughout the whole of that province. In
Scot’s case the advantages it offered may well have
seemed a desirable step to further advances; his
means, as one of a family already distinguished from
the common people, allowing him to plan a complete
course of study, and his ambition prompting him to
follow it.</p>

<p>The common tradition asserts that when he left
Durham, Scot proceeded to Oxford. This is not
unlikely, considering the fame of that University,
and the number of students drawn from all parts of
the land who assembled there.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> The only matters,
however, which offer themselves in support of this
bare conjecture are not, it must be said, very convincing.
Roger Bacon shows great familiarity with
Scot, and Bacon was an Oxford scholar, though his
studies at that University were not begun till long
after the time when Scot could possibly have been
a student there. It is quite possible, however, that
the interest shown by Bacon in Scot’s labours and
high reputation—not by any means of a kindly sort—may
have been awakened by traditions that were
still current in the Schools of Oxford when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
younger student came there. Near the end of his
life, Scot visited in a public capacity the chief
Universities of Europe, and brought them philosophic
treasures that were highly thought of by the
learned. It seems most probable, from the terms
in which Bacon speaks of this journey,<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> that it may
have included a visit to Oxford. This might of
course be matter of mere duty and policy, but one
cannot help observing how well it agrees with the
tradition that these schools were already familiar to
Scot. As a recognised alumnus of Oxford, he would
be highly acceptable there, being one whose European
fame shed no small lustre upon the scene of
his early studies.</p>

<p>As to Paris, the next stage in Scot’s educational
progress, the historian of that University becomes
much more convincing when he claims for <cite>Lutetia</cite>
the honour of having contributed in a special sense
to the formation of this scholar’s mind. For here
tradition has preserved one of those sobriquets
which are almost invariably authentic. Scot, it
seems, gained here the name of <em>Michael the Mathematician</em>,<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
and this corresponds, not only with what
is known concerning the character of his studies, but
also with the nature of the course for which Paris
was then famous. There is another circumstance
which seems to point strongly in the same direction.
Every one must have noticed how invariably the
name of Scot is honoured by the prefix of <em>Master</em>.
This is the case not only in his printed works, but
also in popular tradition, as may be seen in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
well-known rhyme:—‘Maister Michael Scot’s man.’<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
A Florence manuscript, to which we shall presently
refer more fully, throws some light upon the meaning
of this title, by describing Scot as that scholar,
‘who among the rest is known as the chief Master.’<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
It is matter of common knowledge, that this degree
had special reference to the studies of the <i lang="la">Trivium</i>
and <i lang="la">Quadrivium</i>, being the scholastic crown reserved
for those who had made satisfactory progress in the
liberal arts. Scot then, according to the testimony
of early times, was the supreme Master in this
department of knowledge. But it is also certain
that Paris was then recognised as the chief school
of the <i lang="la">Trivium</i> and <i lang="la">Quadrivium</i>, just as Bologna had
a like reputation for Law, and Salerno for Medicine.<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
We are therefore warranted to conclude that Michael
Scot could never have been saluted in European
schools as ‘Supreme Master,’ had he not studied
long in the French capital, and carried off the highly
esteemed honours of Paris.</p>

<p>Another branch of study which tradition says
Scot followed with success at Paris was that of
theology. Du Boulay declares, indeed, that he
reached the dignity of doctor in that faculty, and
there is some reason to think that this may actually
have been the case. There can be no doubt that
an ecclesiastical career then offered the surest road
to wealth and fame in the case of all who aspired to
literary honours. That Scot took holy orders<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> seems
very probable. He may well have done so even
before he came to Paris, for Bacon makes it one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
his reproaches against the corruption of the times,
that men were ordained far too readily, and before
they had reached the canonical age: from their tenth
to their twentieth year, he says.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> It is difficult to
verify Dempster’s assertion that Scot’s renown as
a theologian is referred to by Baconthorpe the
famous Carmelite of the following century.<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> This
author was commonly known as the <i lang="la">Princeps
Averroïstarum</i>. If he really mentions Michael, and
does not mean Duns Scotus, as there is some reason
to suspect, his praise may have been given quite
as much on the ground of profane as of religious
philosophy. On the other hand we find abounding
and unmistakable references to Scripture, the
Liturgy, and ascetic counsels in the writings of
Scot, from which it may safely be concluded that
he had not merely embraced the ecclesiastical
profession as a means of livelihood or of advancement,
but had seriously devoted himself to sacred
studies. It is true that we cannot point to any
instance in which he receives the title of doctor,
but this omission may be explained without
seriously shaking our belief in the tradition that
Scot gained this honour at Lutetia. During the
twelfth century the Bishop of Paris forbade the
doctors of theology to profess that faculty in any
other University.<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Scot may well, therefore, have
been one of those philosophical divines who taught
<i lang="fr">entre les deux ponts</i>, as the same statute commanded
they should, though in other lands and
during his after-life, he came to be known simply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
as the ‘Great Master’: the brightest of all those
choice spirits of the schools on which Paris set
her stamp.</p>

<p>At this point we may surely hazard a further
conjecture. Bacon tells us that in those days it
was the study of law, ecclesiastical and civil, rather
than of theology, which opened the way to honour
and preferment in the Church.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Now Paris was
not more eminently and distinctly the seat of arts
than Bologna was the school of laws.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> May not
Michael Scot have passed from the French to the
Italian University? Such a conjecture would be
worth little were it not for the support which
it undoubtedly receives from credible tradition.
Boccaccio in one of his tales<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> mentions Michael
Scot, and tells how he used to live in Bologna.
Many of the commentators on the <cite>Divine Comedy</cite>
of Dante dwell on the theme, and enrich it with
superstitious wonders.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> It would be difficult to
find a period in the scholar’s life which suits better
with such a residence than that we are now
considering. On all accounts it seems likely
that he left Paris for Bologna, and found in the
latter city a highly favourable opening, which led
directly to the honours and successes of his after-life.</p>

<p>He was now to leave the schools and enter a
wider sphere, not without the promise of high and
enduring fame. A child of the mist and the hill,
he had come from the deep woods and wild outland
life of the Scottish Border to what was already no
inconsiderable position. He knew Paris, not, need<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
it be said, the gay capital of modern days, but Paris
of the closing years of the twelfth century, <i lang="la">Lutetia
Parisiorum</i>: her low-browed houses of wood and
mud; her winding streets, noisome even by day,
and by night still darker and more perilous; her vast
Latin Quarter, then far more preponderant than
now—a true cosmopolis, where fur-clad barbarians
from the home of the north wind sharpened wits
with the Latin races haply trained in southern
schools by some keen-browed Moor or Jew. And
Paris knew him, watched his course, applauded
his success, crowned his fame by that coveted
title of <em>Master</em>, which he shared with many others,
but which the world of letters made peculiarly his
own by creating for him a singular and individual
propriety in it. From Paris we may follow him
in fancy to Bologna, yet it is not hard to believe
he must have left half his heart behind, enchained
in that remarkable devotion which Lutetia could
so well inspire in her children.<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Bologna might
be, as we have represented it, the gate to a new
Eden, that of Scot’s Italian and Spanish life, yet
how could he enter it without casting many a
longing glance behind to the Paradise he had
quitted for ever when he left the banks of the
Seine?</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="smaller">SCOT AT THE COURT OF SICILY</span></h2>

<p>All tradition assures us that the chief occupation
of Scot’s life was found at the Court of Frederick <span class="smcapuc">II.</span>,
King of Sicily, and afterwards Emperor of Germany:
a Prince deservedly famous, not only for
his own talent, but for the protection and encouragement
he afforded to men of learning. A
manuscript in the Laurentian Library,<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> hitherto
unnoticed in this connection, seems to throw some
light upon the time and manner of this employment:
points that have always been very obscure.
The volume is a collection of <i lang="la">Occulta</i>, and at p. 256
we find the following title, ‘An Experiment of
Michael Scot the magician.’ What follows is of
no serious importance: such as it has we shall
consider in speaking of the Master’s legendary
fame. The concluding words, however, are of great
interest, especially when we observe that this part
of the manuscript, though written between 1450
and 1500, is said<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> to have been copied ‘from a
very ancient book.’ The colophon runs thus:
‘Here endeth the necromantic experiment of the
most illustrious doctor, Master<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Michael Scot, who
among other scholars is known as the supreme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Master; who was of Scotland, and servant to his
most distinguished chief Don Philip,<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> the King
of Sicily’s clerk;<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> which experiment he contrived<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
when he lay sick in the city of Cordova. Finis.’</p>

<p>Taking the persons here named in the order of
their rank, we notice first the great Emperor
Frederick <span class="smcapuc">II.</span>, the patron of Michael Scot. It is
worth remark that he is styled simply ‘King of
Sicily,’ a title which belongs to the time previous
to 1215, when he obtained the Imperial crown.
This is a touch which seems to give high originality
and value to the colophon. We may feel sure that
it was not composed by the fifteenth century scribe,
who would certainly have described Frederick in
the usual style as Emperor and Lord of the World.
He must have copied it, and everything leads one
to suppose that he was right in describing the
source from which he drew as ‘very ancient.’</p>

<p>Next comes Don Philip, whom we have rightly
described as the clerk of Sicily, for the word <i lang="la">coronatus</i>
in its mediæval use is derived from <i lang="la">corona</i> in the sense
of the priestly tonsure, so that <i lang="la">Philippus coronatus</i>
is equivalent to <i lang="la">Philippus clericus</i>.<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> Of this distinguished
man we find many traces in the historical
documents of the period.<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> Two deeds passed the
seals of Sicily in the year 1200 when the King,
then a boy of five years old, was living under the
care of his widowed mother the Queen Constantia.
These are countersigned by the royal notary, who
is described as ‘Philippus de Salerno, notarius et
fidelis noster scriba.’ His name is found in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
same way, apparently for the last time, in 1213.
This date, and the particular designation of Philip
the Notary as ‘of Salerno,’ connect themselves very
naturally with the title of a manuscript belonging
to the De Rossi collection.<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> It is as follows: ‘The
Book of the Inspections of Urine according to the
opinion of the Masters, Peter of Berenico, Constantine
Damascenus, and Julius of Salerno; which
was composed by command of the Emperor
Frederick, Anno Domini 1212, in the month of
February, and was revised by Master Philip of
Tripoli and Master Gerard of Cremona at the
orders of the King of Spain,’ etc. The person
designed as Philip of Salerno was very likely to be
put in charge of the revision of a medical treatise,
and as he disappears from his duties as notary for
some time after 1213 we may suppose that it was
then he passed into the service of the King of Spain.
This conjecture agrees also with the mention of
Cordova in the Florence manuscript, and with other
peculiarities it displays, such as the spelling of the
name <i lang="la">Philippus</i> like <i lang="es">Felipe</i>, and the way in which
the title <i lang="la">Dominus</i> is repeated, just as <i lang="es">Don</i> might
be in the style of a Spaniard. There is, in short,
every reason to conclude that Philip of Salerno and
Philip of Tripoli were one and the same person.
We may add that Philip was the author of the first
complete version in Latin of the book called <cite>Secreta
Secretorum</cite>, the preface of which describes him as a
<i lang="la">clericus</i> of the See of Tripoli. As will presently
appear, Michael Scot drew largely from this work
in composing one of his own;<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> another proof that
in confronting with each other these three names—Philippus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
coronatus or clericus; Philippus de
Salerno, and Philippus Tripolitanus—and in concluding
that they belong to one and the same
person, we have a reasonable amount of evidence
in our favour.</p>

<p>From what has just been said it is plain that
three distinct periods must have composed the life
of Philip so far as we know it: the first when he
served as an ecclesiastic in Tripoli of Syria or its
neighbourhood; the second when he came westward,
and, not without a certain literary reputation, held
the post of Clerk Register in Sicily; the last when
Frederick sent him, in the height of his powers and
the fulness of his fame, to that neighbouring
country of Spain, then so full of attraction for every
scholar. In which of these periods then was it that
Michael Scot first came into those relations with
Philip of which the Florentine manuscript speaks?
The time of his residence in Spain, likely as it might
seem on other accounts, would appear to be ruled
out by the fact that it was too late for Philip to
be then described as servant of the <em>King of Sicily</em>.
Nor did he hold this office, so far as we can tell,
until he had left Tripoli for the West. We must
pronounce then for the Sicilian period, and precisely
therefore for the years between 1200 and 1213.
This conclusion, however, does not hinder us from
supposing that the relation then first formally
begun between Michael and Philip continued to
bind them, in what may have been a friendly co-operation,
during the time spent by both in Spain.</p>

<p>The period thus determined was that of the
King’s boyhood, and this opens up another line of
argument which may be trusted not only to confirm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
the results we have reached, but to afford a more
exact view of Scot’s occupation in Sicily. Several
of his works are dedicated to Frederick, from which
it is natural to conclude that his employment
was one which brought him closely in contact
with the person of the King. When we examine
their contents we are struck by the tone which Scot
permits himself to use in addressing his royal
master. There is familiarity when we should expect
flattery, and the desire to impart instruction instead
of the wish to display obsequiousness. Scot
appears in fact as one careless to recommend himself
for a position at Court, certain rather of one
which must have been already his own. What can
this position have been?</p>

<p>A tradition preserved by one of the commentaries
on Dante<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> informs us that Michael Scot was
employed as the Emperor’s tutor, and this explanation
is one which we need feel no hesitation in
adopting, as it clears up in a very convincing way
all the difficulties of the case. His talents, already
proved and crowned in Paris and Bologna, may well
have commended him for such a position. The
dedication of his books to Frederick, and the
familiar style in which he addresses the young prince,
are precisely what might be expected from the pen
of a court schoolmaster engaged in compiling
manuals <i lang="la">in usum Delphini</i>.<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Nay the very title of
‘Master’ which Scot had won at Paris probably
owed its chief confirmation and continued employment
to the nature of his new charge. Since the
fifth century there had prevailed in Spain the habit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
of committing children of position to the course of
an ecclesiastical education.<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> They were trained by
some discreet and grave person called the <i lang="la">magister
disciplinae</i>, deputed by the Bishop to this office.
Such would seem to have been the manner of
Frederick’s studies. His guardian was the Pope;
he lived at Palermo under charge of the Canons of
that Cathedral,<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> and no doubt the ecclesiastical
character of Michael Scot combined with his
acknowledged talents to point him out as a suitable
person to fill so important a charge. It was his
first piece of preferment, and we may conceive that
he drew salary for his services under some title
given him in the royal registry. This would explain
his connection with Philip, the chief notary, on
which the Florentine manuscript insists. Such
fictitious employments have always been a part of
court fashion, and that they were common in Sicily
at the time of which we write may be seen from
the case of Werner and Philip de Bollanden, who,
though in reality most trusted and confidential
advisers of the Crown, were known at Court as the
chief butler and baker, titles which they were proud
to transmit to their descendants.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>It was at Palermo, then, that Michael Scot
must have passed the opening years of the thirteenth
century; now more than ever ‘Master,’ since he was
engaged in a work which carried with it no light
responsibility: the early education of a royal youth
destined to play the first part on the European
stage. The situation was one not without advantages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
of an uncommon kind for a scholar like Scot,
eager to acquire knowledge in every department.
Sicily was still, especially in its more remote and
mountainous parts about Entella, Giato, and Platani,
the refuge of a considerable Moorish population,
whose language was therefore familiar in the island,
and was heard even at Court; being, we are assured,
one of those in which Frederick received instruction.<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
There can be little doubt that Scot availed
himself of this opportunity, and laid a good foundation
for his later work on Arabic texts by acquiring,
in the years of his residence at Palermo, at least the
vernacular language of the Moors.</p>

<p>The same may be said regarding the Greek
tongue: a branch of study much neglected even by
the learned of those times. We shall presently
produce evidence which goes to show that Michael
Scot worked upon Greek as well as Arabic texts,<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
and it was in all probability to his situation in
Sicily that he owed the acquisition of what was
then a very rare accomplishment. Bacon, who
deplores the ignorance of Greek which prevailed in
his days, recommends those who would learn this
important language to go to Italy, where, he says,
especially in the south, both clergy and people are
still in many places purely Greek.<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> The reference
to <i lang="la">Magna Grecia</i> is obvious, and to Sicily, whose
Greek colonies preserved, even to Frederick’s time
and beyond it, their nationality and language. So
much was this the case, that it was thought necessary
to make the study of Greek as well as of Arabic
part of Frederick’s education. We can hardly err<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
in supposing that Scot profited by this as well as
by the other opportunity.</p>

<p>In point of general culture too a residence at
Palermo offered many and varied advantages. Rare
manuscripts abounded, some lately brought to the
island, like that of the <cite>Secreta Secretorum</cite>, the
prize of Philip the Clerk, which he carried with
him when he came from Tripoli to Sicily, and
treasured there, calling it his ‘precious pearl’;<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
others forming part of collections that had for some
time been established in the capital. As early as
the year 1143, George of Antioch, the Sicilian
Admiral, had founded the Church of St. Maria della
Martorana in Palermo, and had enriched it with a
valuable library, no doubt brought in great part
from the East.<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> A better opportunity for literary
studies could hardly have been desired than that
which the Prince’s Master now enjoyed.</p>

<p>The society and surroundings in which Michael
Scot now found himself were such as must have
communicated a powerful impulse to the mind.
The Court was grave rather than gay, as had
befitted the circumstances of a royal widow, and
now of an orphan still under canonical protection
and busied in serious study, but this allowed the
wit and wisdom of learned men free scope, and thus
invited and encouraged their residence. Already,
probably, had begun that concourse and competition
of talents, for which the Court of Frederick was
afterwards so remarkable. Amid delicious gardens
at evening, or by day in the cool shade of courtyards:
those <i lang="it">patios</i> which the Moors had built so
well and adorned with such fair arabesques, all that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
was rarest in learning and brightest in wit, held
daily disputation, while the delicate fountains played
and Monte Pellegrino looked down on the curving
beauties of the bay and shore. A strange contrast
truly to the arcades of Bologna, now heaped with
winter snow and now baked by summer sun; to the
squalor of mediæval Paris, and much more to the
green hillsides and moist forest-clad vales of southern
Scotland. Here at last the spirit of Michael Scot
underwent a powerful and determining influence
which left its mark on all his subsequent life.</p>

<p>As royal tutor, his peculiar duty would seem to
have been that of instructing the young Prince in
the different branches of mathematics. This we
should naturally have conjectured from the fact
that Scot’s fame as yet rested entirely upon the
honours he had gained at Paris, and precisely in
this department of learning; for ‘Michael the
Mathematician’ was not likely to have been called
to Palermo with any other purpose. We have
direct evidence of it however in an early work
which came from the Master’s pen, and one which
would seem to have been designed for the use of
his illustrious pupil. This was the <cite>Astronomia</cite>, or
<cite>Liber Particularis</cite>, and in the Oxford copy,<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> the
colophon of that treatise runs thus: ‘Here endeth
the book of Michael Scot, astrologer to the Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Frederick, Emperor of Rome, and ever August;
which book he composed in simple style<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> at the
desire of the aforesaid Emperor. And this he
did, not so much considering his own reputation, as
desiring to be serviceable and useful to young
scholars, who, of their great love for wisdom, desire
to learn in the Quadrivium the Art of Astronomy.’
The preface says that this was the second book
which Scot composed for Frederick.</p>

<p>The science of Astronomy was so closely joined
in those times with the art of Astrology, that it is
difficult to draw a clear distinction between them
as they were then understood. The one was but
the practical application of the other, and in
common use their names were often confused and
used interchangeably. We are not surprised then
to find the title of Imperial Astrologer given to
Michael Scot in the colophon to his <cite>Astronomia</cite>; he
was sure to be employed in this way, and the fact
will help us to determine with probability what
was the <em>first</em> book he wrote for the Emperor, that
to which the <cite>Liber Particularis</cite> was a sequel. For
there is actually extant under Scot’s name an astrological
treatise bearing the significant name of the
<cite>Liber Introductorius</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> This title agrees exceedingly
well with the position we are now inclined to give
it, and an examination of the preface confirms our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
conjecture in a high degree. It commences thus:
‘Here beginneth the preface of the <cite>Liber Introductorius</cite>
which was put forth by Michael Scot,
Astrologer to the ever August Frederick, Emperor
of the Romans, at whose desire he composed it concerning
astrology,<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> in a simple style<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> for the sake
of young scholars and those of weaker capacity, and
this in the days of our Lord Pope Innocent <span class="smcapuc">IV.</span>’<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
One cannot help noticing the close correspondence
between this and the colophon of the <cite>Astronomia</cite>.
The two treatises were the complement each of the
other. They must have been composed about the
same time, and were doubtless meant to serve as
text-books to guide the studies of Frederick’s youth.
That this royal pupil should have been led through
astrology to the higher and more enduring wonders
of astronomy need cause no surprise, for such a
course was quite in accordance with the intellectual
habits of the age. It may be doubted indeed
whether the men of those times would have shown
such perseverance in the observations and discoveries
proper to a pure science of the heavens, had it
not been for the practicable and profitable interest
which its application in astrology furnished. Astronomy,
such as it then was, formed the last and
highest study in the Quadrivium.<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> It was here that
Scot had carried off honours at Paris, and now in
his <cite>Liber Introductorius</cite> and <cite>Astronomia</cite>, we see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
him imparting the ripe fruits of that diligence to his
royal charge, whose education, so far as regarded
formal study, was thereby brought to a close.</p>

<p>In the year 1209, when Frederick was but
fourteen years of age, the quiet study and seclusion
in which he still lived with those who taught him
was brought to an abrupt and, one must think,
premature conclusion. The boy was married, and
to a lady ten years his senior, Constance, daughter
of the King of Aragon, and already widow of the
King of Hungary. It is not hard to see that such
a union must have been purely a matter of arrangement.
The Prince of Palermo, undergrown and
delicate as he was,<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> promised to be, as King of
Sicily and possibly Emperor, the noblest husband of
his time. Pope Innocent <span class="smcapuc">III.</span>, his guardian, foresaw
this, and chose a daughter of Spain as most fit to
occupy the proud position of Frederick’s wife, queen,
and perhaps empress. Had the wishes of Rome
prevailed at the Court of Aragon from the first,
this marriage would have taken place even earlier
than it did. The delay seems to have been owing,
not to any reluctance on the part of the bride’s
parents, but solely to the doubt which of two sisters,
elder or younger, widow or maid, should accept the
coveted honour.</p>

<p>It was in spring, the loveliest season of the year
in that climate, that the fleet of Spain, sent to bear
the bride and her suite, rose slowly over the sea
rim and dropped anchor in the Bay of Palermo.
Constantia came with many in her company, the
flower of Catalan and Provençal chivalry, led by her
brother, Count Alfonso. The Bishop of Mazara,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
too, was among them, bearing a commission to
represent the Pope in these negotiations and
festivities. And now the stately Moorish palace,
with its courtyard, its fountains, and its gardens,
became once more a scene of gaiety, as—in the great
hall of forty pillars, beneath a roof such as Arabian
artists alone could frame, carved like a snow cave,
or stained with rich and lovely colour like a mass of
jewels set in gold—the officers of the royal household
passed solemnly on to offer homage before their
Prince and his bride. In the six great apartments of
state the frescoed forms of Christian art: Patriarchs
in their histories, Moses and David in their exploits,
and the last wild charge of Barbarossa’s Crusade,<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
looked down upon a moving throng of nobles and
commons who came to present their congratulations,
while the plaintive music of lute, of pipe, and tabor,
sighed upon the air, and skilful dancers swam before
the delighted guests in all the fascination of the
voluptuous East.</p>

<p>What part could Michael Scot, the grave ecclesiastic,
and now doubly the ‘Master’ as Frederick’s
trusted tutor, play in the gay scene of his pupil’s
marriage? For many ages it has been the custom
among Italian scholars, the attached dependants of a
noble house, to offer on such occasions their homage
to bride and bridegroom in the form of a learned
treatise; any bookseller’s list of <i lang="it">Nozze</i> is enough to
show that the habit exists even at the present day.
This then was what Scot did; for there is every reason
to think that the <cite>Physionomia</cite>, which he composed
and dedicated to Frederick, was produced and
presented at the time of the royal marriage. No
date suits this publication so well as 1209, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
nothing but the urgent desire of Court and people
that the marriage should prove fruitful can explain,
one might add excuse, some passages of almost
fescennine licence which it contains.<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> We seem to
find in the advice of the preface that Frederick should
study man, encouraging the learned to dispute in
his presence what may well have been the last
word of a master who saw his pupil passing to scenes
of larger and more active life at an unusually early
age, and before he could be fully trusted to take his
due place in the great world of European politics.</p>

<p>The <cite>Physionomia</cite>, however, is too important a
work to be dismissed in a paragraph. Both the
subject itself, and the sources from which Scot
drew, deserve longer consideration. The science of
physiognomy, as its name imports, was derived
from the Greeks. Achinas, a contemporary of the
Hippocratic school, and Philemon, who is mentioned
in the introduction to Scot’s treatise, seem to have
been the earliest writers in this department of
philosophy. It was a spiritual medicine,<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> and
formed part of the singular doctrine of <em>signatures</em>,
teaching as it did that the inward dispositions of
the soul might be read in visible characters upon
the bodily frame. The Alexandrian school made a
speciality of physiognomy. In Egypt it attained a
further development, and various writings in Greek
which expounded the system passed current during
the early centuries of our era under the names of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Aristotle and Polemon. Through the common
channel of the Syriac schools and language it
reached the Arabs, and in the ninth century had
the fortune to be taken up warmly by Rases and
his followers, who made it a characteristic part of
their medical system. From this source then Scot
drew largely; chapters xxiv.-xxv. in Book <span class="smcapuc">II.</span> of his
<cite>Physionomia</cite> correspond closely with the <cite>De Medicina
ad Regem Al Mansorem</cite><a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> of Rases.<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>Among ancient texts on physiognomy, however,
perhaps the most famous was the <cite>Sirr-el-asrar</cite>, or
<cite>Secreta Secretorum</cite>, which was ascribed to Aristotle.
Its origin, like that of other pseudo-Aristotelic
writings, seems to have been Egyptian. When
the conquests of Alexander the Great had opened
the way for a new relation between East and
West, Egypt, and especially its capital, Alexandria,
became the focus of a new philosophic influence.
The sect of the Essenes, transported hither, had
given rise to the school of the Therapeutae, where
Greek theories developed in a startling direction
under the power of Oriental speculation. The Therapeutae
were sun-worshippers, and eager students
of ancient and occult writings, as Josephus<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> tells us
the Essenes had been. We find in the <cite>Abraxas</cite>
gems, of which so large a number has been preserved,
an enduring memorial of these people and
their system of thought.<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>The preface to the <cite>Sirr-el-asrar</cite> affords several
matters which agree admirably with what we know
of the Therapeutae. The precious volume was the
prize of a scholar on his travels, who found it in
the possession of an aged recluse dwelling in the
<i lang="la">penetralia</i> of a sun-temple built by Æsculapius.<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
All this is characteristic enough, and when we
examine the substance of the treatise it appears
distinctly Therapeutic. Much of it is devoted to
bodily disease, to the regimen of the health, and to
that science of physiognomy which professed to
reveal, as in a spiritual diagnosis, the infirmities of
the soul. The ascription of the work to Aristotle,
Alexander’s tutor, seems quite in accordance with
this theory; in short, there is no reason to doubt
that it first appeared in Egypt, where it probably
formed one of the most cherished texts of the
Therapeutae.</p>

<p>The preface to the <cite>Sirr-el-asrar</cite> throws light
not only upon the origin of the treatise but also
upon its subsequent fortunes. It is said to have
been rendered from the Greek into Chaldee or
Syriac,<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> and thence into Arabic, the usual channel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
by which the remains of ancient learning have
reached the modern world. The translator’s name
is given as Johannes filius Bitricii, but this can
hardly have been the well-known Ibn-el-Bitriq,
the freedman of Mamoun. To this latter author
indeed, the <cite>Fihrist</cite>, composed in 987, ascribes the
Arabic version of Aristotle’s <cite>De Cœlo et Mundo</cite>,
and of Plato’s <cite>Timaeus</cite>, so that his literary
faculty would seem to accord very well with
the task of translating the <cite>Sirr-el-asrar</cite>. But
Foerster has observed<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> that we find no trace of
this book in Arabian literature before the eleventh
century. Now the famous Ibn-el-Bitriq lived in the
ninth, as appears from several considerations. His
works were revised by Honain ibn Ishaq (873),
and, if we believe in the authenticity of the <cite>El
Hawi</cite>, where he is mentioned by name, then he
must have belonged to an age at least as early
as that of Rases who wrote it. In these perplexing
circumstances, Foerster gives up the attempt to
determine who may have been the translator of
the <cite>Sirr-el-asrar</cite>, contenting himself with the conjecture
that some unknown scholar had assumed
the name of El Bitriq to give importance to the
production of his pen. We may be excused,
however, if we direct attention to two manuscripts
of the British Museum<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> which do not seem to
have been noticed by those who have devoted
attention to this obscure subject. One of these,
which is written in a hand of the thirteenth
century, informs us that the man who transcribed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
it was a certain Said Ibn Butrus ibn Mansur, a
Maronite priest of Lebanon in the diocese of
Tripolis, a prisoner for twelve years in the place
where the royal standards were kept (? at Cairo),
who was released from that confinement in the
time of <em>al Malik an Nazir</em>. The other—a mere
fragment—contains a notice of the priest Yahyā,
or Yuhannā, ibn Butrus, who died in the year
1217 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> It is not unlikely that some confusion
might arise between the names Patrick and Peter,
often used interchangeably. ‘Filius Patricii’ then
may have been no assumed designation, but the
equivalent of Ibn Butrus, the real name of this priest
of Tripoli, who was perhaps the translator of the
<cite>Sirr-el-asrar</cite> at the close of the twelfth century.</p>

<p>Those chapters of the <cite>Sirr-el-asrar</cite> which relate
to regimen were translated into Latin by Johannes
Hispalensis. Jourdain identifies this author with
John Avendeath, who worked for the Archbishop
of Toledo between the years 1130 and 1150.<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> But
Foerster shows that caution is needed here.<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> The
Latin version was dedicated to Tarasia, Queen of
Spain. A queen of this name certainly lived contemporaneously
with John Avendeath, but she
was Queen of Portugal. Another Tarasia, however,
was Queen of Leon from 1176 to 1180. We may
observe that this latter epoch agrees well enough
with the lifetime of Ibn Butrus, who died in 1217,
and we find trace of another Johannes Hispanus,
who was a monk of Mount Tabor in 1175. Such
a man, who from his situation in Syria could
scarcely have been ignorant of Arabic, and whose
nationality agrees so well with a dedication to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
the Queen of Spain, and who was a contemporary
of Tarasia of Leon, may well have translated the
<cite>Sirr-el-asrar</cite> into Latin. That part of the book
thus made public in the West appeared under
the following title: ‘De conservatione corporis
humani, ad Alexandrum.’ It is found in several
manuscripts of the Laurentian Library in Florence.<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>Soon afterwards, and probably in the opening
years of the thirteenth century, the whole book
was published in a Latin version by the same
Philippus Clericus, with whom we have already
become acquainted. We may recall the fact that
he belonged to the diocese of Tripoli, as Ibn
Butrus also did, and as Johannes Hispanus was
also a monk of Syria, these three scholars are seen
to be joined by a link of locality highly increasing
the probability that they actually co-operated in
the publication of this hitherto unknown text.
In his preface, Philip speaks of the Arabic manuscript
as a precious pearl, discovered while he
was still in Syria. This leads us to think that
his work in translating it was done after he had
left the East, and possibly in the course of his
voyage westward. We know that the Hebrew
version of Aristotle’s <cite>Meteora</cite> was produced in
similar circumstances. Samuel ben Juda ben
Tibbun says he completed that translation in the
year 1210, while the ship that bore him from
Alexandria to Spain was passing between the
isles of Lampadusa and Pantellaria.<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> However
this may be, Philip of Tripoli dedicated his version
of the <cite>Sirr-el-asrar</cite>, which he called the <cite>Secreta<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Secretorum</cite>, to the Bishop under whom he had
hitherto lived and laboured: ‘Guidoni vere de
Valentia, civitatis Tripolis glorioso pontifici’: a
name and title little understood by the copyists,
who have subjected them to strange corruptions.<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>It is highly in favour of our identifying, as
we have already done, Philip of Tripoli, the
translator of the <cite>Secreta</cite>, with Philip of Salerno,
the Clerk Register of Sicily, that we find Michael
Scot, who stood in an undoubtedly close relation
to the Clerk Register, showing an intimate acquaintance
with the <cite>Secreta Secretorum</cite>. Foerster has
given us a careful and exact account of several
passages in different parts of the <cite>Physionomia</cite> of
Scot, which have their correspondences in the
works of Philip, so that it is beyond question that
the Latin version of the <cite>Secreta</cite> was one of the
sources from which Scot drew. Before leaving
this part of the subject, we may notice that translations
of Philip’s version into the vernacular
languages of Italy, France, and England were
made at an early date, both in prose and verse.<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
The English version of the <cite>Secreta</cite> came from the
hand of the poet Lydgate.</p>

<p>Another treatise of the same school, to which
Scot was also indebted, is to be found in the <cite>Physionomia</cite>
ascribed, like the <cite>Secreta</cite>, to Aristotle. The
Latin version of this apocryphal work was made, it
is said, directly from a Greek original, by Bartholomew
of Messina. This author wrote for Manfred
of Sicily, and at a time which excludes the
notion that Scot could have seen or employed his
work. Yet several passages in the preface to
Book <span class="smcapuc">II.</span> of Scot’s <cite>Physionomia</cite> have evidently
been borrowed from that of the Pseudo-Aristotle.
As no Arabic version of the treatise is known to
exist, the fact of this correspondence is one of
the proofs on which we may rely in support of
the conclusion that Scot must have known and
used the Greek language in his studies.</p>

<p>The last two chapters of Book <span class="smcapuc">I.</span> in the <cite>Physionomia</cite>
of Scot show plainly that he had the
Arabic version of Aristotle’s <cite>History of Animals</cite>
before him as he wrote. We shall recur to this
matter when we come to deal with the versions
which Scot made expressly from these books.
Meanwhile let us guard against the impression
naturally arising from our analysis of the <cite>Physionomia</cite>,
that it was a mere compilation. Many
parts of the work show no correspondence with any
other treatise on the subject that is known to us,
and these must be held as the results of the author’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
own observations. The arrangement of the whole
is certainly original, nor can we better conclude our
study of the <cite>Physionomia</cite>, than by giving a comprehensive
view of its contents in their order. The
work is divided into three books, each having its
own introduction. The first expounds the mysteries
of generation and birth, and reaches, as we have
already remarked, even beyond humanity to a considerable
part of the animal world so much studied
by the Arabians. The second expounds the signs
of the different complexions, as these become visible
in any part of the body, or are discovered by
dreams. The third examines the human frame
member by member, explaining what signs of the
inward nature may be read in each. The whole
forms a very complete and interesting compendium
of the art of physiognomy as then understood, and
must have seemed not unworthy of the author, nor
unsuitable as an offering to the young prince, who
by marriage was about to enter on the great world
of affairs, where knowledge of men would henceforth
be all-important to his success and happiness. The
book attained a wide popularity in manuscript, and
the invention of printing contributed to increase its
circulation in Europe:<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> no less than eighteen editions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
are said to have been printed between 1477 and
1660.<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>In the copy preserved at Milan, the <cite>Physionomia</cite>
is placed immediately after the <cite>Astronomia</cite>, or
<cite>Liber Particularis</cite>. A similar arrangement is found
in the Oxford manuscript. This fact is certainly in
favour of the view we have adopted, and would seem
to fix very plainly the date and relation of these
works. They stand beside the <cite>Liber Introductorius</cite>,
and, together with it, form the only remains
we have of Scot’s first literary activity, being publications
that were called out in the course of his
scholastic duty to the King of Sicily. The <cite>Liber
Introductorius</cite> opens this series. It is closely
related by the nature of its subject-matter to the
<cite>Astronomia</cite>, or <cite>Liber Particularis</cite>, while the <cite>Physionomia</cite>
forms a fitting close to the others with which
it is thus associated. In this last treatise Michael
Scot sought to fulfil his charge by sending forth
his pupil to the great world, not wholly unprovided
with a guide to what is far more abstruse and incalculable
than any celestial theorem, the mystery of
human character and action.</p>

<p>In presenting the <cite>Physionomia</cite> to Frederick,
Scot took what proved a long farewell of the Court;
for many years passed before he saw the Emperor
again. The great concourse of the Queen’s train,
together with the assembly of Frederick’s subjects
at Palermo, bred a pestilence under the dangerous
heats of spring. A sudden horror fell on the
masques and revels of these bright days, with the
death of the Queen’s brother, Count Alfonso of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
Provence, and several others, so that soon the fair
gardens and pleasant palace were emptied and
deserted as a place where only the plague might
dare to linger. The King and Queen, with five
hundred Spanish knights and a great Sicilian following,
passed eastward; to Cefalù first, and then
on to Messina and Catania, as if they could not
put too great a distance between themselves and
the infected spot. Meanwhile Michael Scot, whose
occupation in Palermo, and indeed about the King,
was now gone, set sail in the opposite direction and
sought the coast of Spain. Whether the idea of
this voyage was his own, was the result of a royal
commission, or had been suggested by some of the
learned who came with Queen Constantia from her
native land, it is now impossible to say. It was in
any case a fortunate venture, which did much, not
only for Scot’s personal fame, but for the general
advantage in letters and in arts.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="smaller">SCOT AT TOLEDO</span></h2>

<p>In following the course which Michael Scot held in
his voyage to Spain, we approach what was beyond
all doubt the most important epoch in the life of
that scholar. Hitherto we have seen him as the
student preparing at Paris or Bologna for a brilliant
future, or as the tutor of a youthful monarch, essaying
some literary ventures, which justified the
position he held in Sicily, and recommended him
for future employment. But the moment was now
come which put him at last in possession of an
opportunity suitable to his training and talents.
We are to see how he won in Spain his greatest
reputation in connection with the most important
literary enterprise of the age, and one which is
indeed not the least remarkable of all time.</p>

<p>The part which the Arabs took in the intellectual
awakening of Europe is a familiar theme of
early mediæval history. That wonderful people,
drawn from what was then an unknown land of the
East, and acted on by the mighty sense of religion
and nationality which Mohammed was able to
communicate, fell like a flood upon the weak remains
of older civilisations, and made huge inroads upon
the Christian Empire of the East. Having reached
this point in their career of conquest they became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
in their turn the conquered, not under force of arms
indeed, but as subdued by the still vital intellectual
power possessed by those whom they had in
a material sense overcome. In their new seat by
the streams of the Euphrates they learned from
their Syrian subjects, now become their teachers,
the treasures of Greek philosophy which had been
translated into the Aramaic tongue. Led captive
as by a spell, the Caliphs of the Abassid line, especially
Al Mansour, Al Rachid, and Al Mamoun,
encouraged with civil honours and rewards the
labours of these learned men. Happy indeed was
the Syrian who brought to life another relic of the
mighty dead, or who gave to such works a new
immortality by rendering them into the Arabic
language.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the progress of the Ommiad arms,
compelled to seek new conquests by the defeat they
had sustained in the East from the victorious
Abbassides, was carrying the Moors west and ever
westward along the northern provinces of Africa.
Egypt and Tripoli and Tunis successively fell before
their victorious march; Algiers and Morocco shared
the same fate, and at last, crossing the Straits of
Gibraltar, the Moors overran Spain, making a new
Arabia of that western peninsula, which in position
and physical features bore so great a likeness to
the ancient cradle of their race.</p>

<p>It is true indeed that long ere the period of
which we write the Moorish power in the West had
received a severe check, and had, for at least a
century, entered on its period of decay. The battle
of Tours, fought in 732, had driven the infidels
from France. The Christian kingdoms of Spain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
itself had rallied their courage and their forces,
and, in a scene of chivalry, which inspired many a
tale and song, had freed at least the northern
provinces of that country from the alien power.
But weapons of war, as we have already seen in
the case of the Arabs themselves, are not the only
means of conquest. The surest title of the Moors
to glory lies in the prevailing intellectual influence
they were able to exert over that Christendom
which, in a political sense, they had failed to
subdue and dispossess. The scene we have just
witnessed in the East was now repeated in Spain,
but was repeated in an exactly opposite sense.
The mental impulse received from the remains of
Greek literature at Bagdad now became in its
turn the motive power which not only sufficed to
carry these forgotten treasures westward in the
course of Moorish conquest, but succeeded, through
that nation, in rousing the Latin races to a sense of
their excellence, and a generous ambition to become
possessed of all the culture and discipline they were
capable of yielding.</p>

<p>The chief centre of this influence, as it was the
chief scene of contact between the two races,
naturally lay in Spain. During the ages of Moorish
dominion the Christians of this country had lived
in peace and prosperity under the generous protection
of their foreign rulers. To a considerable
extent indeed the Moors and Spaniards amalgamated
by intermarriage. The language of the
conquerors was familiarly employed by their
Spanish subjects, and these frequented in numbers
the famous schools of science and literature established
by the Moors at Cordova, and in other cities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
of the kingdom. Proof of all this remains in the
public acts of the Castiles, which continued to be
written in Arabic as late as the fourteenth century,
and were signed by Christian prelates in the same
characters;<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> in the present language of Spain which
retains so many words of eastern origin; but, above
all, in the profound influence, now chiefly engaging
our attention, which has left its mark upon almost
every branch of our modern science, literature, and
art.</p>

<p>This result was largely owing to a singular
enterprise of the twelfth century with which the
learned researches of Jourdain have made us familiar.<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
Scholars from other lands, such as Constantine,
Gerbert, afterwards Pope Sylvester <span class="smcapuc">II.</span>, Adelard of
Bath, Hermann, and Alfred and Daniel de Morlay,
had indeed visited Spain during that age and the one
which preceded it, and had, as individuals, made
a number of translations from the Arabic, among
which were various works in medicine and mathematics,
as well as the first version of the Koran.
But in the earlier half of the twelfth century, and
precisely between the years 1130 and 1150, this
desultory work was reduced to a system by the
establishment of a regular school of translation in
Toledo. The credit of this foundation, which did
so much for mediæval science and letters, belongs
to Don Raymon, Archbishop of Toledo and Primate
of Spain. This enlightened and liberal churchman
was by origin a French monk, born at Agen, whom
Bernard, a previous Primate, had brought southward
in his train, as he returned from a journey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
beyond the Pyrenees. Don Raymon associated with
himself his Archdeacon, Dominicus Gundisalvus, and
a converted Jew commonly known as Johannes
Hispalensis or John of Seville, whom Jourdain has
identified with Johannes Avendeath: this latter
being in all probability his proper name. These
formed the heads of the Toledo school in its earliest
period, and the enterprise was continued throughout
the latter half of the century by other scholars, of
whom Gherardus Cremonensis the elder was probably
the chief. Versions of the voluminous works of Avicenna,
as well as of several treatises by Algazel and
Alpharabius, and of a number of medical writings,
were the highly prized contribution of the Toledo
school to the growing library of foreign authors
now accessible in the Latin language.</p>

<p>It is probable that when Michael Scot left Sicily
he did so with the purpose of joining this important
enterprise. His movements naturally suggest such
an idea, as he proceeded to Toledo, still the centre
of these studies, and won, during the years of his
residence there, the name by which he is best
known in the world of letters, that of the chief
exponent of the Arabo-Aristotelic philosophy in the
West.</p>

<p>The name and fame of Aristotle, never quite forgotten
even in the darkest age,<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> and now known and
extolled among Moorish scholars, formed indeed the
ground of that immense reputation which Arabian
philosophy enjoyed in Europe. The Latin schools
had long been familiar with the logical writings of
Aristotle, but the modern spirit, soon to show<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
itself as it were precociously in Bacon and Albertus
Magnus, was already awake, and under its influence
men had begun to demand more than the mere
training of the mind in abstract reasoning. Even
the application of dialectics to evolve or support
systems of doctrine drawn from Holy Scripture
could not content this new curiosity. Men were
becoming alive to the larger book of nature which
lay open around them, and, confounded at first by
the complexity of unnumbered facts in sea and sky,
in earth and air, they began to long for help from
the great master of philosophy which might guide
their first trembling footsteps in so strange and
untrodden a realm of knowledge. Nor was the hope
of such aid denied them. There was still a tradition
concerning the lost works of Aristotle on physics.
The Moors, it was found, boasted their possession,
and even claimed to have enriched these priceless
pages by comments which were still more precious
than the original text itself.</p>

<p>The mere hope that it might be so was enough
to beget a new crusade, when western scholars vied
with each other in their efforts to recover these lost
treasures and restore to the schools of Europe the
impulse and guidance so eagerly desired. Such
had, in fact, been the aim of Archbishop Raymon
and the successive translators of the Toledan school.
The important place they assigned to Avicenna
among those whose works they rendered into Latin
was due to the fact that this author had come to be
regarded in the early part of the twelfth century as
the chief exponent of Aristotle, whose spirit he had
inherited, and on whose works he had founded his
own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>The part of the Aristotelic writings to which
Michael Scot first turned his attention would seem
to have been the history of animals. This, in the
Greek text, consisted of three distinct treatises:
first the <cite>De Historiis Animalium</cite> in ten books; next
the <cite>De Partibus Animalium</cite> in four books; and
lastly, the <cite>De Generatione Animalium</cite> in five books.
The Arabian scholars, however, who paid great
attention to this part of natural philosophy and
made many curious observations in it, were accustomed
to group these three treatises under the
general title <cite>De Animalibus</cite>, and to number their
books or chapters consecutively from one to nineteen,
probably for convenience in referring to them.
As Scot’s work consisted of a translation from
Arabic texts it naturally followed the form which
had been sanctioned by the use and wont of the
eastern commentators.</p>

<p>At least two versions of the <cite>De Animalibus</cite> appeared
from the pen of Scot. These have sometimes
been confounded with each other, but are
really quite distinct, representing the labours of
two different Arabian commentators on the text of
Aristotle. We may best commence by examining
that of which least is known, the <cite>De Animalibus ad
Caesarem</cite>, as it is commonly called, and this the
rather that there is good reason to suppose it represents
the first Arabian work on Natural History
which came into Scot’s hands.</p>

<p>Nothing is known certainly regarding the author
of this commentary. Jourdain and Steinschneider
conclude with reason that the text must have been
an Arabic and not a Hebrew one, as Camus<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Wüstenfeld<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> contend. No one, however, has hitherto
ventured any suggestion throwing light on the
personality of the writer. The colophon to the
copy of Scot’s version in the <cite>Bibliotheca Angelica</cite> of
Rome contains the word <em>Alphagiri</em>, which would
seem to stand for the proper name Al Faquir.
But in all probability, as we shall presently show,
this may be merely the name of the Spanish Jew
who aided Michael Scot in the work of translation.</p>

<p>The expression ‘secundum extractionem Michaelis
Scoti,’ which is used in the same colophon, would
seem to indicate that this version, voluminous as it
is, was no more than a compend of the original.
The title of the manuscript too: ‘Incipit flos primi
libri Aristotelis de Animalibus’ agrees curiously with
this, and with the word <em>Abbreviatio</em> (<em>Avicennae</em>),
used to describe Scot’s second version of the <cite>De
Animalibus</cite> of which we are presently to speak. Are
we then to suppose that in each case the translator
exercised his faculty of selection, and that the form
of these compends was due, not to Avicenna, nor to
the unknown author of the text called in Scot’s
version the <cite>De Animalibus ad Caesarem</cite>, but to
Scot himself? The expressions just cited would
seem to open the way for such a conclusion.</p>

<p>The contents of the <cite>De Animalibus ad Caesarem</cite>
may be inferred from the Prologue which is as
follows: ‘In Nomine Domini Nostri Jesu Christi
Omnipotentis Misericordis et Pii, translatio tractatus
primi libri quem composuit Aristoteles in
cognitione naturalium animalium, agrestium et
marinorum, et in illo est conjunctionis animalium
modus et modus generationis illorum cum coitu,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
cum partitione membrorum interiorum et apparentium,
et cum meditatione comparationum eorum, et
actionum eorum, et juvamentorum et nocumentorum
eorum, et qualiter venantur, et in quibus locis sunt,
et quomodo moventur de loco ad locum propter dispositionem
presentis aetatis, aestatis et hiemis, et
unde est vita cuiuslibet eorum, scilicet modorum
avium, et luporum, et piscium maris et qui ambulant
in eo.’ It seems tolerably certain that the substance
of this prologue came from the Arabic
original, which must have commenced with the
ascription of praise to God so commonly employed
by Mohammedans: ‘Bi-smilláhi-r-rahhmáni-r-rahheém’
(In the Name of God, the Compassionate;
the Merciful).<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> The clumsiness of the
Latin, which here, as in the body of the work, seems
to labour heavily in the track of a foreign text,<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> adds
force to this assumption. The hand of Scot is seen,
however, where the name of our Saviour has been
substituted for that of Allah, and also in the closing
words, which ring with a strong reminiscence of the
eighth Psalm. The churchman betrays himself here
as in not a few other places which might be quoted
from his different writings.</p>

<p>By far the most interesting matter, however,
which offers itself for our consideration here, lies in
the comparison we are now to make between this
book and a former work of Scot, the <cite>De Physionomia</cite>.
This comparison, which has never before been attempted,
will throw light on both these texts, but
has a special value as it affords the means of dating,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
at least approximately, the composition of Scot’s
version of the <cite>De Animalibus ad Caesarem</cite>.</p>

<p>We have already remarked that the last two
chapters of the first book of the <cite>Physionomia</cite> suggest
that in compiling them the author had before
him an Arabic treatise on Natural History. A
natural conjecture leads us further to suppose that
this may have been the original from which he
translated the <cite>De Animalibus ad Caesarem</cite>, and
this idea becomes a certainty when we pursue the
comparison a little more closely. Take for example
this curious passage from the <cite>Physionomia</cite> (Book <span class="smcapuc">I.</span>
chap, ii.): ‘Incipiunt pili paulatim oriri in pectine
unitas quorum dicitur femur … item sibi vox
mutatur.’ Its obscurity disappears when we confront
it with the corresponding words in the <cite>De Animalibus
ad Caesarem</cite>, and thus discover what was no doubt
the original source from which Scot derived it:
‘Incipiunt pili oriri in pectore <em>Kameon alkaratoki</em>,
et in isto tempore mutatur vox eius.’<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> There is no
need to extend the comparison any further than
this significant passage. Doubt may arise regarding
the depth and accuracy of Scot’s knowledge of the
Arabic tongue, the nature of the text that lay
before him, or the reason he may have had for
retaining foreign words in the one version which he
translated in the other; but surely this may be
regarded as now clearly established, that some part
of the first book of the <cite>Physionomia</cite> was derived by
compilation from the same text which appeared in
a Latin dress as the <cite>De Animalibus ad Caesarem</cite>,
and that this source was an Arabic one.</p>

<p>This point settled, it becomes possible to establish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
another. One of the copies of the <cite>De Animalibus
ad Caesarem</cite><a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> has the following colophon: ‘Completus
est liber Aristotelis de animalibus, translatus
a magistro michaele in tollecto de arabico in
latinum.’ Now if the version was made in Toledo,
it was probably posterior in date to the <cite>Physionomia</cite>.
This indeed is no more than might have been asserted
on the ground of common likelihood; for,
when a compilation and a complete version of one
of the sources from which it was derived are both
found passing under the name of the same author,
it is but natural to suppose that the first was made
before the other, and that in the interval the author
had conceived the idea of producing in a fuller form
a work he had already partially published.</p>

<p>Resuming then the results we have reached, it
appears that Scot had met with this Arabic commentary
on the Natural History of Aristotle while
he was still in Sicily, and had made extracts from
it for his <cite>Physionomia</cite>. Coming to Spain he probably
carried the manuscript with him, and as his
version of the <cite>De Animalibus ad Caesarem</cite> seems to
have been the first complete translation he made
from the Arabic, and to have been published shortly
after he came to the Castiles, he may possibly have
begun work upon it even before his arrival there.
On every account, there being no positive evidence
to the contrary, we may conjecture that the <cite>De
Animalibus ad Caesarem</cite>, like the <cite>Physionomia</cite>,
belongs to the year 1209. If the latter work
appeared at Palermo in time for the royal marriage,
which took place in spring, the former may well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
have been completed and published towards the end
of the same year, when Scot had no doubt been
already some time settled in Toledo.</p>

<p>The second form in which Michael Scot produced
his work upon the Natural History of Aristotle was
that of a version called the <cite>Abbreviatio Avicennae</cite>.
The full title as it appears in the printed copy<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> is:
‘Avicenna de Animalibus per Magistrum Michaelem
Scotum de Arabico in Latinum translatus.’ Like
the <cite>De Animalibus ad Caesarem</cite> it consists of
nineteen books, thus comprehending the three
Aristotelic treatises in one work.</p>

<p>The name of <em>Ibn Sina</em> or Avicenna, the author
of the Arabic original, is significant, as it enables
us to connect in a remarkable way the present
labours of Scot’s pen with those which had in a
past age proceeded from the school of translators at
Toledo, and to place the <cite>Abbreviatio</cite> in its true
relation with the system of versions which had been
published there nearly a century before. We have
already remarked that Don Raymon directed the
attention of his translators to Avicenna as the best
representative, both of Aristotle himself and of the
Arabian wisdom which had gathered about his
writings. A manuscript of great interest preserved
in the library of the Vatican<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> shows what the
labours of Gundisalvus, Avendeath, and their coadjutors
had been, and how far they had proceeded
in the task of making this author accessible to
Latin students. From it we learn that the <cite>Logic</cite>,
the <cite>Physics</cite>, the <cite>De Cœlo et Mundo</cite>, the <cite>Metaphysics</cite>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
the <cite>De Anima</cite>, called also <cite>Liber sextus de
Naturalibus</cite>; and the <cite>De generatione Lapidum</cite> of
Avicenna, had come from the school of Toledo
during the twelfth century in a Latin dress. The
last-named treatise was apparently a comment on
the <cite>Meteora</cite> of Aristotle, and the whole belonged to
that <cite>Kitab Alchefâ</cite>, which was called by the Latins
the <cite>Assephae</cite>, <cite>Asschiphe</cite> or <cite>Liber Sufficientiae</cite>. This
collection was said to form but the first and most
common of the three bodies of philosophy composed
by Avicenna. It represented the teaching of
Aristotle and the Peripatetics, while the second
expounded the system of Avicenna himself, and
the third contained the more esoteric and occult
doctrines of natural philosophy.<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> Of these the
first alone had reached the Western schools.</p>

<p>It is plain then that until Michael Scot took the
work in hand Toledo had not completed the Latin
version of Avicenna by translating that part of the
<cite>Alchefâ</cite> which concerned the Natural History of
Animals. The <cite>Abbreviatio Avicennae</cite> thus came to
supply the defect and to crown the labours of the
ancient college of translators. This place of honour
is actually given to it in the Vatican manuscript
just referred to, where it follows the <cite>De generatione
Lapidum</cite>, and forms the fitting close of that remarkable
series and volume. Thus, while the <cite>De
Animalibus ad Caesarem</cite> connects itself with the
<cite>Physionomia</cite>, and with Scot’s past life in Sicily, the
<cite>Abbreviatio Avicennae</cite> joins him closely and in a
very remarkable way with the whole tradition of
the Toledo school, of which, by this translation, he
at once became not the least distinguished member.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;" id="illus3">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>The authority of this manuscript, now perhaps
for the first time appealed to, is sufficient not only
to determine the relation of Scot’s work to that of
the earlier Toledan school, but even, by a most
fortunate circumstance, enables us to feel sure of
the exact date when the translation of the <cite>Abbreviatio</cite>
was made. For the colophon to the Vatican manuscript,
brief as it is, contains in one line a fact of
the utmost interest and importance to all students
of the life of Scot. It is as follows: ‘<span id="erratum">Explicit
anno Domini mºcºcºx</span>.’<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> The researches of Jourdain
had the merit of making public two colophons from
the manuscripts of Paris, containing the date of
another and later work of Scot,<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> but since the days
of that savant no further addition of this valuable
kind has been made to our knowledge of the
philosopher’s life. The date just cited from the
Vatican copy of the <cite>Abbreviatio</cite> shows, however,
that further inquiry in this direction need not be
abandoned as useless. We now know accurately
the time when this version was completed, and find
the date to be such as accords exactly with our idea
that Scot must have quitted Sicily soon after the
marriage of Frederick; for the year 1210 may be
taken as a fixed point determining the time when
he first became definitely connected with the Toledo
school. It will be remembered that we anticipated
this result of research so far as to use it in our
attempt to conjecture the date of Scot’s birth.<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>Like the <cite>De Animalibus ad Caesarem</cite>, the <cite>Abbreviatio
Avicennae</cite> bears a dedication to Frederick
conceived in the following terms: ‘<cite>O Frederick,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
Lord of the World and Emperor, receive with
devotion this book of Michael Scot, that it may be
a grace unto thy head and a chain about thy neck.</cite>’<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>
It will always be matter of doubt whether in this
address Scot appealed to a taste for natural history
already formed in his pupil before he left Palermo,
or whether the interest subsequently shown by this
monarch in studying the habits of animals was
awakened by the perusal of these two volumes. In
any case they must have done not a little to guide
both his interest and his researches. The chroniclers
tell us of Frederick’s elephant, which was sent to
Cremona, of the cameleopard, the camels and
dromedaries, the lions, leopards, panthers, and rare
birds which the royal menagerie contained, and of
a white bear which, being very uncommon, formed
one of the gifts presented by the Emperor on an
important occasion. We hear too that Frederick,
not content with gathering such rarities under his
own observation, entered upon more than one curious
experiment in this branch of science. Desiring to
learn the origin of language he had some children
brought up, so Salimbene tells us, beyond hearing
of any spoken tongue. In the course of another
inquiry he caused the surgeon’s knife to be ruthlessly
employed upon living men that he might lay
bare the secrets and study the process of digestion.
If these experiments do not present the moral
character of the Emperor in a very attractive light,
they may at least serve to show how keenly he was
interested in the study of nature.</p>

<p>This interest indeed went so far as to lead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Frederick to join the number of royal authors by
publishing a work on falconry.<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> In it he ranges
over all the species of birds then known, and insists
on certain rarities, such as a white cockatoo, which
had been sent to him by the Sultan from Cairo.
He thus appears in his own pages, not merely as a
keen sportsman, but as one who took no narrow
interest in natural history. Clearly the dedication
of the <cite>De Animalibus</cite> and the <cite>Abbreviatio
Avicennae</cite> was no empty compliment as it flowed
from the pen of Scot. He had directed his first
labours from Toledo to one who could highly appreciate
them, and to these works must be ascribed,
in no small measure, the growth of the Emperor’s
interest in a subject then very novel and little
understood.</p>

<p>As regards the <cite>Abbreviatio Avicennae</cite> indeed,
we have actual evidence of the esteem in which
Frederick held it. The book remained treasured in
the Imperial closet at Melfi for more than twenty
years, and, when at last the Emperor consented to
its publication, so important was the moment
deemed, that a regular writ passed the seals giving
warrant for its transcription.<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> Master Henry of
Colonia<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> was the person selected by favour of
Frederick for this work, and, as most of the manuscripts
of the <cite>Abbreviatio</cite> now extant have a
colophon referring in detail to this transaction, we
may assume that Henry’s copy, made from that
belonging to the Emperor, was the source from
which all others have been derived.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>This Imperial original would seem to be more
nearly represented by the Vatican copy<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> than by
any other which remains in the libraries of Europe.
From it we discover that the Arabic names with
which the <cite>Abbreviatio</cite> abounds were given in Latin
in the margin of the original manuscript, which
Scot sent to the Emperor.<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> These hard words and
their explanations were afterwards gathered in a
glossary, and inscribed at the end of the treatise; an
improvement which was probably due to Henry of
Colonia. The glossary has, however, been quite
neglected by later copyists, nor does it appear in
the printed edition of the <cite>Abbreviatio Avicennae</cite>.
The completeness with which it is found in the
Vatican manuscript shows the close relation which
that copy holds to the one first made by the
Emperor’s permission. The Chigi manuscript<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>
seems to be the only other in which the glossary is
to be found. It therefore ranks beside that of the
Vatican, but is inferior to it as it presents the
glossary in a less complete form.</p>

<p>The originality of the Vatican text perhaps
appears also in the curious triplet with which it
closes: ‘Liber iste inceptus est et expletus cum
adiutorio Jesu Christi qui vivit, etc.</p>

<p>To whatever period it belongs, the writer’s purpose
was doubtless to recall to the mind the four nations
over which Frederick <span class="smcapuc">II.</span> ruled, and the splendid
kingdoms of Sicily, Germany, and Jerusalem which
he gathered in one under his imperial power.</p>

<p>In the Laurentian Library there is a valuable
manuscript, written during the summer and autumn
of 1266, for the monks of Santa Croce.<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> It contains
the <cite>De Animalibus ad Caesarem</cite>; the <cite>Abbreviatio
Avicennae</cite>, and, as a third and concluding
article, an independent version of the <cite>Liber de
Partibus Animalium</cite>, corresponding, as has been
said, to books xi.-xiv. of the other versions which the
volume contains. Bandini, in the printed catalogue
of the library, asserts that this third translation,
unlike the two which precede it, was made from
the Greek. This is probably correct, as it was only
the Greek text which treated these four chapters of
the Natural History as a distinct work. He further
ascribes the version to Michael Scot, relying no
doubt on the general composition of the volume,
for this particular translation does not seem to contain
any direct evidence of authorship. Thus the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
doubt expressed by Jourdain in this matter<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> is not
without reason, though the balance of probability
would seem to incline in favour of Bandini’s opinion;
for such a volume can scarcely be assumed to have
been a mere miscellany without clear evidence that
the contents come from more than one author.
Taking it for granted then that the <cite>De Partibus
Animalium</cite> came from Scot’s pen, then this is the
third form in which his labours on the Natural
History of Aristotle appeared.</p>

<p>In any case, however, his chief merit in this
department of study belonged to Michael Scot as
the exponent of the Arabian naturalists. It is
difficult for any one who has not read the books in
question to form an adequate idea of their contents,
and still more of their style; even from the most
careful description. We are made to feel that the
task of the translator must have been a very difficult
one. There is a concentration combined with
great wealth of detail, and withal a constant nimble
transition from one subject to another, seemingly
remote, under the suggestion of some subtle connection,
which result in a style almost baffling to one
who sought to reproduce it in his comparatively
slow and clumsy Latin.</p>

<p>No greater contrast could be imagined than that
which separates such works from those which are the
production of our modern writers on the same subject.
Nor does this difference depend, as one might
suppose, on the fact that a wider field of observation
is open to us, and more adequate collections of
facts are at our disposal. Rather is it the case that
between ancients and moderns, between the eastern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
and western world, there is an entirely different
understanding of the whole subject. A different
principle of arrangement is at work, and results in
the wide diversity of manner which strikes us as
soon as we open the <cite>De Animalibus</cite> or the <cite>Abbreviatio</cite>.
We find ourselves in the presence of a
system of ideas, more or less abstract, which a
wealth of facts derived from keen and wide observation
of the world of nature is employed to illustrate.
There is a finer division than with us.
The unit in these works is not the species nor even
the individual, but some single part or passion.
This the author follows through all he knew of the
multitudinous maze of nature, comparing and discerning
and recording with a <i lang="fr">bizarrerie</i> which comes
to resemble nothing so much as the fantastic dance
of form and colour in a kaleidoscope.</p>

<p>‘Birds,’ says Avicenna,<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> ‘have a way of life that
is peculiar to themselves. Those that are long-necked
drink by the mouth, then lift their head till
the water runs down their neck. The reason of this
is that their neck is long and narrow, so that they
cannot satisfy their thirst by putting beak in water
and straightway drinking. There is, however, a
great difference between different birds in their
way of drinking, and the mountain hog loveth roots
to which his tusk helpeth, wherewith he turneth up
the ground and breaketh out the roots. Six days
or thereabout are proper for his fattening, wherein
he drinketh not for three, and there are some who
feed their hogs and yet will not water them for
perchance seven days on end. And in their fattening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
all animals are helped by moderate and gentle
exercise, save the hog, who fatteneth lying in the
mud, and that mightily, for thereby his pores are
shut upon him so that he loseth nothing by evaporation.
And the hog will fight with the wolf,
and that is his nature, and cows fatten on every
windy thing, such as vetches, beans, and barley,
and if their horns be anointed with soft wax,
straightway, even while still upon the living animal,
they become soft, and if the horns of ox or cow be
anointed with marrow, oil, or pitch, this easeth
them of the pain in their feet after a journey.’</p>

<p>In another place<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> he continues: ‘Some animals
have teeth which serve them not save for fighting,
and not for the mastication of their food. Such are
the hog and the elephant, for the elephant’s tusks
are of use to him in this matter as we have said.
And there are animals which make no use of their
teeth save for eating or fighting, nay, I believe
that every animal having teeth will fight with
them upon occasion, and some there are whose
teeth are sharp and stand well apart, so that they
are therewith furnished to tear prey: such is the
lion. And those animals that have need to crop
their food, as grass and the like, from the ground,
have level and regular teeth, and not long tusks
or canines, which would hinder them from cropping;
and since in some kinds the males are more apt
to anger than the females, tusks have been given
them that they may defend the females, because
these are weaker in themselves and of a worse
complexion, and this is true in a general way of
all animals, even in those kinds that eat no flesh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
and need not their tusks for eating, but only for
defence, such as boars, and this is the reason why
they have the strength of which we have just
spoken. It is the same with the camel, and so
we pass to speak of this general truth as it
appears with regard to all other means of defence.
Hence hath the stag his horn and not the hind;
the ram and not the ewe; the he-goat and not
his female, and fish which eat not flesh have no
need of teeth that are sharp.’</p>

<p>The city where these strange writings were
deciphered and translated into Latin, being itself
so strange and remote from the ways of modern
life, had a certain poetic fitness as the scene
where Michael Scot undertook his labours upon
the Arabian authors. No passage of all their
texts was more bizarre and tortuous than the
mass of intricate lanes which formed then, as
they form to-day, the thoroughfares of communication
in Toledo. No hidden jewel of knowledge
and observation could surprise and reward
the translator in the midst of his tedious labours
with a flash of sudden light and glory more
unexpectedly delicious than that felt by the
traveller, when, after long wandering in that maze
and labyrinth, he finds a wider air; a stronger
light beats before him, beckoning, and in a moment
he stands in the full sunshine of the <i lang="es">plaza mayor</i>,
with space to see and light to show the wonders
of mind and hand, and all the toil of past ages
in the fabric of the great cathedral.</p>

<p>Such as it now stands, the Cathedral of Toledo
had not yet begun to rise above ground when
Michael Scot had his residence there, but enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
of the ancient city remains to show what Toledo
must have been like in these early days. The
splendid and commanding site, swept about by
the waves of the Tagus; the famous bridge of
Alcantara; the steep slope of approach crowned
by ancient fortifications; and above all the massed
and massive houses of the old town, so closely
crowded together as hardly to give room for
streets that should rather be called lanes; all
this, beneath the unchanging sky of the south,
recalls sufficiently what must have been the surroundings
of Scot’s life during ten laborious years.
Even yet, where white-wash peels and stucco fails,
strange records of that forgotten past reveal themselves
in the walls and on the house fronts:
sculptured stones of every age; bas-reliefs, arabesques;
windows in the delicate Moorish manner
of twin arches, and a central shaft with carved
cornices, long built up and forgotten till accident
has revealed them.</p>

<p>Here then, perhaps in some house still standing,
the scholar come from Sicily made his home.
The quiet courtyard is forgotten; the <i lang="es">azulejos</i>
have disappeared from walls and pavement; the
rich wood-work of the ceilings, still bearing dim
traces of colour and gold, looks down on the life
of another age; even the curious cedar book-chest
has crumbled to dust, for all its delicate defence
of ironwork spreading away like a spider’s web
from hinges and from lock. But the name and
the fame endure, and the years which Michael
Scot spent in Toledo have left a deep mark upon
that and every succeeding age.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="smaller">THE ALCHEMICAL STUDIES OF SCOT</span></h2>

<p>The Moorish schools of Spain were famous, not
only for their researches in natural history, but
also for the interest they took in chemistry, then
called alchemy: a name which sufficiently indicates
the nation which chiefly pursued these studies,
and the language that recorded their progress.
The practical turn taken by alchemy, as the foundation
of a scientific <i lang="la">materia medica</i> in minerals, is
shown by the writings of Rases. This author,
who belonged to the ninth and tenth centuries
(860-940), produced a considerable work on medicine
in which he devoted special attention to the
diseases of children. Under his name appeared
several alchemical writings, either his own or the
productions of the school which followed his teaching
and borrowed his name.</p>

<p>Michael Scot, as we know, had become familiar
with the works of Rases while still in Sicily, and
thought so highly of the <cite>De Medicina</cite> as to borrow
thence for his treatise on physiognomy no fewer
than thirty-one chapters relating to that subject.<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>
It is a natural conjecture then which leads us to
find in his acquaintance with this author’s writings
the starting-point of Scot’s interest both in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
medicine and in alchemy. Leaving for the present
what may hereafter be said of his name and fame as
a physician, let us examine the origin and nature of
his work as a student of the Arabian chemistry.
We have reached what would seem to be the
proper moment for such an inquiry. The treatises
of Michael Scot on this subject are not dated
indeed, but their form shows them to belong to the
epoch of his work as a translator. They were
therefore probably produced during the period of
his residence at Toledo, and as there is a long
interval, otherwise unaccounted for, between 1210,
when the <cite>Abbreviatio Avicenna</cite> appeared, and the
date of his next publication some seven years
later, this blank cannot be better filled than
by supposing that it was during these years he
found time for the study of alchemy, and for the
translation or composition of the writings in that
branch of science which still bear his name.</p>

<p>In this, as in almost all his other studies,
Michael Scot sat at the feet of Eastern masters.
But the Arabians themselves had derived their
chemical science, at least in its first principles and
primitive processes, from still older peoples. If we
are to understand the progress of human thought in
this science we must trace it from the beginning,
following again that beaten track of tradition by
which not physiognomy and alchemy alone, but
almost all the secrets of early times, have reached
the modern world.</p>

<p>Primitive chemistry was closely connected with
the still older art of metallurgy, out of which it
arose by a natural process of development. Those
who worked with ores soon discovered the secret of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
alloys, whereby a considerable quantity of baser
metal, such as copper, lead or tin, could be added
to gold or silver, so as greatly to increase the bulk
of the whole without injuring either its appearance
or usefulness. The problem of the crown set before
Archimedes, and happily solved by that philosopher
in the bath, shows how dexterously alloys were
used by the Greeks, and what subtle means were
necessary for their detection.</p>

<p>M. Berthelot has reminded us<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> that the transmission
of receipts for such processes from early
times to our own has been naturally and inevitably
secured by the unbroken continuity of practice in
the arts which gave them birth, and that they thus
passed safely from generation to generation, and
even spread from the tribes that originated them to
other and distant peoples. He cites in support of
this observation a papyrus of the third century,
preserved at Leyden, which, he says, contains what
are substantially the same directions as those of the
chief mediæval authorities in such matters: the
<cite>Mappae Clavicula</cite> and the <cite>Compositiones ad Tingenda</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>
These receipts are not unnaturally entitled
‘How to make Gold,’ and it is curious to
find in them the veritable starting-point of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
dreams which made so many a furnace smoke, and
so many a crucible glow during the course of
centuries, in the vain hope of effecting an actual
transmutation of substance.</p>

<p>Thus it was that in the first ages, long before
authentic record, in the dimness of early Egyptian
history, or of that still more ancient Pelasgic civilisation
from which the pyramid-builders learned so
much, the germs of this science may already be
perceived. Only one source of genuine gold seems
then to have been known: the mines of Ophir. This
circumstance, by making the supplies of precious
metal small and uncertain, mightily encouraged the
art which taught men to counterfeit its appearance
in a colourable way. How this was done may be
judged of by the receipts themselves. The <cite>Mappae
Clavicula</cite>, for instance, has the following: ‘To
make gold. Silver, one pound; copper, half-a-pound;
gold, a pound; melt, etc.’ Here indeed a
considerable proportion of the precious metal itself
was required, but there are other receipts which
dispense with any such admixture. It is said, for
example, that one hundred parts of copper and
seventeen of zinc joined in a state of fusion with
divers small proportions of magnesia, sal ammoniac,
quicklime, and tartar, yield an alloy which is fine
in grain and malleable, which may be polished and
used in damascening just as if it were the pure
gold that it has all the appearance of being. Such
then were the receipts which formed the hereditary
riches of the mighty clan of the <em>Smiths</em>. It is easy
to see how the famous ‘powder of projection,’ so
much sought in later times, was, in fact, but the
transfiguration of one of these formulae.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>When, during the early centuries of the
Christian era, the traditions of Greece found a new
home in lower Egypt, and especially in Alexandria,
they were profoundly influenced by the still more
ancient philosophy of the East. We have already
remarked this in the case of another science, that of
physiognomy, but the same influence may also be
traced in the modification it brought to the notions
of primitive chemistry. The Chaldæans and
Persians had long believed that the heavens influenced
the earth, and were capable of producing
strange effects in the lower spheres of being.<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> Their
wise men considered that an individual connection
could be established between the stars and the
elements, the planets and the metals. It was in
contact with this new doctrine and under its influence
that there arose the hope, soon hardening
into a settled belief, that the rules of art might be
sufficient to effect an actual transmutation of the
baser into the nobler metals, of copper into gold,
and of tin or lead into silver.</p>

<p>This opinion must have been immensely
heightened, and its authority reinforced, by the
secrecy with which the receipts for alloying
metals were guarded. These were handed down
orally from father to son; were not committed to
writing till a comparatively late period, and even
then remained for the most part the cherished
treasures of temple guilds. On the well-known
principle of the proverb, ‘Omne ignotum pro magnifico’
this secrecy tended to confirm the impression
that, however much had been communicated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
more remained untold, to await discovery by the
patient and undaunted chemist. The Therapeutæ
or Essenes were among the earliest representatives
of this new tendency, as appears from the
testimony of Josephus,<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> who describes them as not
only devoted to ancient writings, but eager to investigate
the properties of minerals. The chief
object of their inquiries, the maintenance of health
by medicines thus derived from the vegetable and
mineral kingdoms, is not only an early instance of the
connection between chemistry and pharmacy, but is
remarkable as the probable starting-point of the
search for the elixir of life: that other and nobler
dream which so much of the enthusiastic energy
of the mediæval alchemists was spent to realise.</p>

<p>The point of connection between these speculations
of Eastern philosophy and the practice of the
primitive chemistry may with probability be sought
in the fire which of necessity played so large a part
in the operations of the metal-worker. Fire bore a
highly sacred character in the philosophy and religion
of the East. This element, it soon came to be
thought by those whom Eastern speculation influenced,
might be trusted not only to melt, to
calcine and to sublime in the vulgar way, but to
form the long-sought link of sympathy between the
stars of heaven, themselves compact of fire, and the
elements of earth, as these were subjected to its
piercing and transforming power. In its due employment
the suspected connection between the
higher and lower worlds would become an accomplished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
fact. Thus, under the power of the planets,
in some favourable hour and fortunate conjunction,
the mighty work would be done: the philosopher’s
stone discovered, the metals transmuted, and the
elixir of life produced.</p>

<p>It is highly curious to find this idea presented in
a novel and perhaps an exaggerated form by a writer
of the sixteenth century. This was Fra Evangelista
Quattrami of Gubbio, <i lang="it">semplicista</i>, or master of the
still-room, to the Cardinal d’Este. He wrote a
book entitled, <cite>The true declaration of all the
metaphors, similitudes, and riddles of the ancient
Alchemical Philosophers, as well among the Chaldeans
and Arabians as the Greeks and Latins</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>
According to this work, the potable gold; the elixir
of life; the quintessence, and the philosopher’s
stone were nothing but fantastic names for the fire
itself which was used in distillation and other
chemical operations. In this the Frate may possibly
have touched the true sense of Al Kindi at least,
who, in his commentary on the <cite>Meteora</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> speaks of
fire as if it were the all in all of the alchemist.</p>

<p>While the primitive chemical practice followed
the progress of the arts which it served, the new
theory of alchemy, with the ever-growing tradition
of fantastic experiments arising out of it, found
different and less direct channels in its descent from
ancient to modern times. It has been customary
to speak of the Arabs as if that nation had been the
chief means of transmitting the knowledge of Greek
doctrine to our mediæval scholars, but we now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
know that there was a previous link in the chain of
intellectual succession. This was supplied by the
care and industry of the Syrian subjects of the early
Caliphs, nor did their learned men play a less important
part in the history of chemistry than in
that of the other sciences. Sergius of Resaina, a
scholar of the fifth century, was, it is said, the first
Syrian who attempted to translate the Greek
chemists, several of whom mention him by name.
The chief development of this work belongs, however,
to the ninth and tenth centuries, and its glory
must ever remain with the great school of Bagdad.
Chemical treatises composed by Democritus and
Zosimus<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> were there and then rendered into Syriac,
as may be seen by the manuscripts still preserved
in the British Museum and at Cambridge.</p>

<p>It was not long before the Arabs themselves
began to feel powerfully the intellectual impulse
thus communicated to them in the heart of a
country which they had made their own. Khaled
ben Yezid ibn Moauia, who died in the year 708, is
said by their historians to have been the first of that
nation who devoted his attention to chemistry. In
his case the filiation of doctrine would seem very
plain, as he was the pupil of a Syrian monk named
Mariannos. Djabar, the <em>Geber</em> of Western writers,
followed in the same line of study, and from the
ninth century there was a regular school of Arabian
chemists whose labours may be studied in the
manuscript collections of Paris and Leyden.</p>

<p>In the eleventh century appeared a curious phenomenon,
in the shape of a dispute among the
Arabians of that day regarding the truth of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
tradition which pronounced the transmutation of
metals possible. The unwearied but still unavailing
experiments which had now been carried on through
several ages, produced at last their inevitable effect
in the shape of philosophic doubt, eagerly urged on
the one part and as eagerly repelled on the other.
The chemical school was now divided according to
these opposite opinions, and each party in their
writings sought to give weight to what they taught
by borrowing in support of their arguments the
names of the mighty dead. In this conflict it was
left to the followers of Rases to sustain the affirmative
and to assert the possibility of transmutation.
These were the apologists for the past, and the
advocates, in the name of their great master, of
that hope which had inspired previous research and
borne fruit in so many important discoveries.</p>

<p>The defence of the new doubt belonged on the
other hand to the school of Al Kindi. This chemist
lived and died during the ninth century. He was
probably the earliest Arabian commentator on
Aristotle, and seems to have paid special attention
to the <cite>Meteora</cite> of that author. The treatise <cite>De
Mineralibus</cite>, so often appended to the <cite>Meteora</cite> as
a supplement, is ascribed to Al Kindi in the Paris
manuscript.<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> It represents the alchemy of the
time.</p>

<p>Between these two contending parties stood the
school of Avicenna, which now occupied an intermediate
position and doubted of the doubt. That
this had not always been the opinion of Avicenna
himself is plain, however, from a passage which
occurs in his <cite>Sermo de generatione lapidum</cite>, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
the author unhesitatingly pronounces against the
theory of transmutation. ‘Those of the chemical
craft,’ he says, ‘know well that no change can be
effected in the different species of things, though
they can produce the appearance of them: tinging
that which is ruddy with yellow till it looks like
gold, and that which is white with colour at their
pleasure till the same effect is in great measure produced.
Nay, they can also remove the impurity
from lead, so that it looks like silver, though it be
lead still, and can endue it with such strange
qualities as to deceive men’s senses, and this by the
use of salt and sal ammoniac.’<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> Avicenna was
evidently well acquainted with the secrets of art
and held them at their proper value. Had his
followers in the eleventh century done the same
they would have supported the school of Al Kindi
instead of taking a less definite position.</p>

<p>This view of the later Arabian schools and their
differences is forced upon us by the fact, that works
are extant under the names of Rases, Al Kindi, and
Avicenna, which evidently belong to the eleventh
century, the period when they first appeared, and
could not therefore have been written by authors
who lived at an earlier date. They are plainly the
production of later chemists who followed more or
less intelligently the doctrine of these great masters
in alchemy. The artifice involved in this ascription
of authorship is one which has always been common
in Eastern literature.</p>

<p>We have a direct interest in observing that
Spain was the country where these developments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
of the later Arabian chemistry arose, contended and
flourished. Spain, therefore, during the eleventh
and twelfth centuries, became, by the attraction
she offered to European scholars, the country where
these theories first reached the Latin races, and
began to find an entrance among them. M.
Berthelot indeed, by a happy citation, has enabled
us to fix, almost with certainty, the very moment
of this important event. Robert Castrensis, the
author alluded to, remarks: ‘Your Latin world
has not as yet learned the doctrine of Alchemy.’
These words are taken from the preface to this
author’s version of the <cite>Liber de Compositione
Alchimiae</cite>, and a colophon informs us that the
translation was completed on the 11th of February
1182. We may add that the same year, corrected,
however, in one copy to 1183, was the date of
another of these versions of the Arabian chemistry:
that of the treatise called <cite>Interrogationes Regis
Kalid, et responsiones Morieni</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> Here then we
stand on the threshold of a new age, and find ourselves
in presence of an intellectual movement
which was certainly of the greatest importance,
since in it we may trace the origin of our modern
chemistry. The knowledge of what had already
been gained by Greek and Arabian alchemists was
the first step to independent research among the
Latins. The closing years of the twelfth century
saw that knowledge at last beginning to unfold
itself in a form intelligible to the Western schools.</p>

<p>As in Bagdad during the ninth century, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
palmy period of Syrian studies, so in Spain three
hundred years later, the work was in its commencement
essentially one of interpretation, and the
first age of these labours was distinguished by the
number of versions which were then produced.
From 1182, through the whole of the following
century, students laboured in the translation of
Moorish books on chemistry. Only towards the
close of this period did a tendency become apparent
which led in the direction of improvement and
innovation. The seed already sown had begun to
bear fruit. The material thus derived from Eastern
sources was now treated with a new freedom, enriched
by the results of original experiment, and edited
in forms which betray the influence of scholastic
philosophy. The criticism, however, which would
determine the precise point when this change
began to be operative, and the extent to which
it proceeded, attempts what is perhaps an impossible
and certainly a difficult task. For it
is a remarkable fact that no Arabic texts
have been preserved to us which can be regarded
as the originals from which these earlier Latin
versions were made. This want is probably due
to the widespread destruction which overtook the
Moorish libraries of Spain.<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> That such originals
did at one time exist, however, is made certain
by the correspondence which the Latin translations
show with those which have come down to us in
another language, the Hebrew. The labours of
these Latin translators during a hundred years
may be found in the manifold collections of chemical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
treatises, containing some forty or fifty articles
apiece, which were arranged and copied out at
the beginning of the fourteenth century. These
volumes became, after the invention of printing,
the chief quarry whence were composed the <cite>Ars
Aurifera</cite>; the <cite>Theatrum Chemicum</cite> of Zetzner, and
the <cite>Bibliotheca</cite> of Manget.</p>

<p>We are now in a position to understand, not
only the nature and progress of the work in which
Michael Scot took part, but the exact development
which alchemy had reached in his day, and therefore
the relation which his chemical publications
bore to the general direction of study in this
department of science. The time and care which
our survey of the field has demanded need not
be thought ill spent. It has prepared the way for
a more intelligent appreciation of Scot’s labours as
a chemist, and has furnished us with the means
of coming to a true judgment regarding their
authenticity and value.</p>

<p>To put the matter to the proof: we may begin
by dismissing altogether from consideration a
treatise which has long been attributed to Scot,
and still appears in the most recent list of his
works: the <cite>Quaestio curiosa de natura Solis et
Lunae</cite>. It has probably received more attention
than it deserves since it appeared under Scot’s
name in the <cite>Theatrum Chemicum</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> The subject<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
of this treatise is indeed an alchemical one; for
the <em>sun</em> and <em>moon</em> of which it speaks are not these
heavenly bodies themselves, but, by an allegorical
use common in the Middle Ages, and derived from
the Eastern theories of sympathy already mentioned,
stand for the nobler metals of gold and silver.
A brief examination, however, shows that Scot
could not have been the author. The very style
suggests this conclusion; for it is distinctly scholastic,
and proper therefore to a later age than
that which aimed at the direct and simple reproduction
of Eastern texts. It is satisfactory to find
that this criticism, hardly convincing <i lang="la">per se</i>, is
fully borne out by what occurs in the substance
of the work itself. The author quotes from the
<cite>De Mineralibus</cite> of Albertus. Now Albertus Magnus,
by common testimony, produced this treatise after
the year 1240, and we may anticipate what is
afterwards to be told of Michael Scot’s death
so far as to say here that he had then been
long in his grave. The <cite>De Natura Solis et
Lunæ</cite> then must be ascribed to some other and
later alchemist, who lived in the end of the
thirteenth or the beginning of the fourteenth
century. A more careful examination of the
treatise than has been necessary for our purpose
might succeed in fixing its date with greater precision,
and might possibly throw some light upon
the person of its true author.</p>

<p>Another work ascribed to the pen of Michael
Scot, and one which seems likely to be authentic,
is that contained in the Speciale Manuscript. This
volume is one of those collections of alchemical
tracts made in the fourteenth century to which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
we have already alluded. It belonged to the
library of the Speciale family in Palermo, and has
been made the subject of an interesting monograph
by Carini.<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> No. 44 of this manuscript is entitled
<cite>Liber Magistri Miccaelis Scotti in quo continetur
Magisterium</cite>. The term <em>Magisterium</em>, or supreme
secret of art, would seem to carry with it a certain
reference to Aristotle, ‘Il <em>Maestro</em> di color che
sanno,’ as Dante calls him.<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> Curious as the appearance
of such a name in connection with alchemy
may seem to us, it is certain that Aristotle held
a high place in the chemical traditions of the
Middle Ages. The <cite>Meteora</cite> afforded a text which
lent itself readily to large commentaries by the
Arabian chemists. The tract <cite>De Mineralibus</cite>,
which we noticed when speaking of Al Kindi, was
one of these commentaries, and it is easy to see how
it became confused with the text which it illustrated
so as in time to be considered the work of Aristotle
himself. This, we may believe, was the ground on
which so many alchemical works were afterwards
published under the same mighty name.<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> An interesting
example appears in the Speciale collection
itself which contains the following title: <cite>Liber
perfecti Magisterii Aristotelis qui incipit cum studii
solertis indigere</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> The treatise <cite>Cum studii</cite> is also
found in the Paris manuscript,<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> where it is ascribed
to Rases. To the school of Rases then we are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
inclined to attribute the works on the <cite>Magisterium</cite>,
and among the rest therefore, this treatise in the
Speciale Manuscript, which bears the name of
Michael Scot, seemingly because he translated it
from the Arabic. This conclusion is confirmed
when we notice the character of some of the chapter
headings as given by Carini; for example: ‘Qualiter
<em>Venus</em> mutatur in <em>Solem</em>’; and again, ‘Transformatio
<em>Mercurii</em> in <em>Lunam</em>.’ These show beyond all
doubt that the doctrine which Michael Scot published
by means of this version was that held by
the school of Rases.</p>

<p>A curious question here offers itself for our consideration.
In the times of Robert Castrensis
alchemy was as yet unknown to the Latins.
Michael Scot, as we shall presently see, described it
in one of his works as meeting with but a poor
reception at its first introduction among them.<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>
How then did it come to pass that in a few years
the theory of Rases became so popular in the West,
and continued for so many ages to direct the progress
of chemical study among the European nations
with enduring power? We find the explanation of
this sudden change in the fact that human thought
has always been subject to the tyranny of ruling
ideas. In our own day the place of direction is
filled by a doctrine of development which is eagerly
made use of in every department of knowledge. In
those earlier ages the same place seems to have
been held by a doctrine of <em>transformation</em>. This
idea ruled the thoughts of men like an obsession, in
whatever direction they turned their minds. We
see it in their superstitions, suggesting the wild<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
tales of were-wolves and of other animal forms
assumed at will by wizard and witch. We find it
in religion, infusing a new meaning into the hyperbolical
language of still earlier times, till, under this
direction, there came to be fastened upon the
Church a full-formed doctrine of Transubstantiation.<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>
It is the operation of the same idea then
that we are to remark also in the scientific sphere.
As soon as the first shock of their surprise was
over, the Latins greedily embraced a theory of
chemical change which related itself so naturally to
the prevailing habit of their minds, and which
promised to show as operative in the mineral
kingdom a law already conceived to hold good in
the world of organic life.</p>

<p>The Riccardian Library of Florence possesses
another of those volumes to which we have already
referred: a collection of alchemical treatises formed
in the end of the thirteenth or beginning of the
fourteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> Among these appears one
called the <cite>Liber Luminis Luminum</cite>. It is said to
have been translated by Michael Scot, and, as there
is no reason to doubt this ascription, we have now
the means of determining with some fulness and
accuracy the lines on which the philosopher proceeded
in his chemical researches.</p>

<p>The book opens with a preface somewhat scholastic,<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>
and one which, on this ground as well as on
others, is probably to be ascribed to Scot himself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
In this part of the work he informs us that he took
as his basis in the following compilation a text called
the <cite>Secreta Naturae</cite>. To it he added material
derived from other sources, which seemed necessary
in order to complete the doctrine of chemistry contained
in the <cite>Secreta</cite>. In this way he endeavoured
to present his readers with a full and practical body
of Alchemy according to the teaching of the school
to which he belonged.</p>

<p>In the study of a composite work, such as the
<cite>Liber Luminis</cite> is thus declared to be, our first
problem is naturally to determine and separate the
original text from the additions which have been
made to it. Which then are those parts of the
<cite>Liber Luminis</cite> that represent the <cite>Secreta Naturae</cite>?
Very fortunately the volume where the <cite>Liber
Luminis</cite> is found contains another treatise that
throws considerable light on the matter. This is
the <cite>Liber Dedali Philosophi</cite>. The correspondences
between that book and the <cite>Liber Luminis</cite> are so
many, close, and verbal, that it is evident both have
borrowed from the same source. This source can
hardly have been other than the <cite>Secreta Naturae</cite>,
so that a comparison of these two books such as is
attempted in the Appendix<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> should go far to determine
what that hitherto unknown text was.</p>

<p>The question of the chemical doctrine contained
in the <cite>Secreta</cite> is an interesting one, and we shall
return to it, but meanwhile, let us observe that the
<cite>Liber Luminis</cite> contains hints which seem to carry
us further still, and throw some light upon the
source from which the <cite>Secreta</cite> was itself derived.
One of the authors quoted is a certain ‘Archelaus.’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Now there was a veritable chemist of this name who
lived during the fifth century. This author wrote a
treatise on his art in Greek verse. In later times
his name seems to have become common property,
as did so many others distinguished in alchemy, and
to have been freely used by some who wrote long
after his day. Thus the Riccardian manuscript
itself contains no less than three books ascribed to
this author: the <cite>Liber Archelai Philosophi de arte
alchimiae</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> called also in the margin <cite>Practica
Galieni in Secretis secretorum</cite>;<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> the <cite>Summula</cite>, ‘quam
ego Archilaus transtuli de libro secretorum’;<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> and
finally the <cite>Mappa Archilei nobilis philosophi</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>The fact that these titles mention the <cite>Secreta</cite> is
enough to show us that in following up the alchemy
of the Pseudo-Archelaus, we are on the right track.
As we proceed the traces become still more interesting
and significant. The <cite>Summula</cite> offers the following
curious passage: ‘Et hoc feci amore Dei et
cuidam compatri meo, qui pauper sint [<i lang="la">sic</i>] et
infortunatus, et postea fortunatus fortuna bona et
amore Imperatoris Emanuelis et Frederici.’<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p>The name Emanuel is found in other alchemical
writings. The <cite>De Perfecto Magisterio</cite>, for example,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
which has been reprinted by Zetzner, embodies
another work, the <cite>Liber duodecim aquarum</cite> which
is expressly said to be taken from the ‘Liber
Emanuelis.’ Pursuing the matter further still, we
come to the <cite>Liber Aristotelis</cite> which commences,
‘Cum de sublimiori atque precipuo.’ The author of
this treatise, we find, claims not only the <cite>Liber
duodecim aquarum</cite> (‘quae qualiter se habeant in
libro quem <span class="smcapuc">XII.</span> aquarum vocabulo descripsimus,
prudens lector intelligere poterit’), but also, it
would seem, the very one of which we are in search
(‘in libro secretorum a nobis dictum est’). Everything
inclines us to the belief that we here touch
the source from which the main part of the <cite>Liber
Luminis</cite> was drawn, and this conclusion is not a
little strengthened when we observe that the
treatise ‘Cum de sublimiori’ is called the <cite>Lumen
Luminum</cite> in the Riccardian copy.<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p>The <cite>Secreta</cite>, however, was not the only source
from which the <cite>Liber Luminis</cite> and the <cite>Liber Dedali</cite>
were drawn, and the assertion of the preface that
the former was composed of extracts from many
different philosophers is fully borne out when we
examine the substance of the books themselves. A
strain of Greek influence is to be traced, for example,
in the names of Archelaus, Dedalus, Plato, and
Hermes, as well as in the use of <em>ciatus</em> as an equivalent
for the word ‘cup,’ and this reminds us
strongly of the <cite>Summula</cite> with its reference to the
Emperor Manuel. It is not impossible that Scot
may have borrowed much from the Byzantine
chemists of the twelfth century. With this notion
agrees the passage of the <cite>Liber Dedali</cite> where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
Saracens are spoken of as foreigners. On the other
hand, much had evidently been taken from Arabic
sources, as is plain from the names given to several
of the vessels used in alchemy, such as the <em>alembic</em>
and <em>aludel</em>. Indeed, Unay and Melchia, who are
quoted in the <cite>Liber Luminis</cite>, must have been Moors,
for the corresponding passage of the <cite>Liber Dedali</cite>
describes them as from ‘Lamacha of the Saracens.’
Both these texts agree in showing such familiarity
with the process of refining sulphur that one is led
to suppose the <cite>Secreta</cite>, their common original, may
have been composed in Sicily. The <cite>Liber Luminis</cite>
says of one of the alums that it is ‘brought from
Spain:’ an expression agreeing well with the notion
of a Sicilian author, who would naturally speak of
Spain as a foreign land.</p>

<p>Leaving, however, these questions of origin and
derivation, let us come to that of the chemical
doctrine taught in the book which Michael Scot
compiled, or at least translated. The title of the
<cite>Liber Luminis Luminum</cite> is a significant one, and
has a real relation to the contents of the work
itself.<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> To discover the sense which it must be held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
to bear we have only to turn to the passage in
which, speaking of alum, the author says: ‘sicut
illuminat pannos, ita illuminat martem ut recipiat
formam lunae. Ut enim lana illuminatur ita et
metalla illuminantur.’<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> A distinction is clearly
present in the writer’s mind between the substance
and the form of the metals. He probably held
that there existed but one common metallic substance,
which assumed the appearance of iron,
gold, or silver, according to the form which it had
received. His employment of the title <cite>Liber
Luminis Luminum</cite> was meant to indicate that
the purpose of his book was that of teaching the
student how metals might best be purified and
improved. Their inferiority, when of the baser
kind, he conceived as an impurity, manifesting itself
in the imperfect forms of lead, iron, tin, and copper.
He believed that this being removed or changed by
art, they might be made to shine with the lustre
and indeed possess the only distinctive quality of
gold and silver. That we have rightly read the
meaning of this title seems plain from a curious
spelling which may be noticed in the <cite>Liber Dedali</cite>.
‘Illuminantur’ there appears as ‘aluminantur.’
The chemistry taught in these books did in fact prescribe
the use of alum as a great means of purifying
and refining the metals.</p>

<p>The preface of the <cite>Liber Luminis</cite> closes with a
brief summary of the chapters which compose the
work itself. The first of these deals with the
different salts used in this chemistry: common salt;
rock salt; alkali; sal ammoniac; nitre and others.
The second treats in like manner of the various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
kinds of alum, the third describes the vitriols, and
the fourth the powders or spirits, by which we are to
understand those minerals which are capable of
being sublimed or made volatile, such as sulphur,
arsenic, and mercury. Two supplementary chapters,
the one on the preparation of the salts, alums, and
vitriols, and the other on that of the remaining
class of chemicals, complete the whole book. This
supplement seems genuinely such, as it is not mentioned
in the general contents, as these appear in
the preface. Perhaps we do not err if we suppose
it to have embodied the result of Scot’s own
experiments in alchemy.</p>

<p>It is indeed the practical nature of the alchemical
doctrine taught in the <cite>Liber Luminis</cite> which strikes
us most strongly when we read this book. A large
part of it is taken up with exact descriptions of the
minerals, according to their various forms and the
countries from which they were derived. The rest
consists of receipts for their employment in refining
metals. Whatever we may think of the validity
and use of these processes, we cannot fail to notice
that they are described in a perfectly straightforward
and simple style. Here are none of the mysteries,
the riddles and ridiculous allegories so common in
chemical works written at a later time. The truth
of the matter may probably be that, in following
the doctrine here set forth, Michael Scot and the
alchemists of his time did obtain results which were
then so surprising, as to excuse a certain exaggeration
in those who described them. Tests that could
touch and reveal the real nature of the metals under
any change of outward appearance were not then so
well known as now. Copper that had been made to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
shine like gold, or to assume the appearance of
silver, was practically gold or silver to those who had
no means of discovering that the real nature of the
metal itself remained unchanged. Thus then are to
be understood the assertions of the <cite>Liber Luminis</cite>
regarding transmutation. They are plainly made
in all good faith, and depend on the doctrine already
mentioned, which held that the differences between
the metals were an affair of the superficial form
rather than of the underlying substance. To
change the appearance of one metal to that of
another, was therefore to effect a real transmutation:
the only one conceivable by the philosophers
of that time. When the <cite>Liber Luminis</cite> speaks of
giving copper ‘a good colour,’ or preparing iron to
‘receive the appearance (<i lang="la">formam</i>) of silver,’ these
expressions reveal with frank sincerity the conceptions
of this alchemy and the results it endeavoured
to obtain.</p>

<p>One other alchemical work attributed to the pen
of Michael Scot remains to be noticed; the <cite>De
Alchimia</cite>, contained in a manuscript of Corpus
Christi College, Oxford.<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> Tanner in his <cite>Bibliotheca</cite>
has noticed this work in the following terms:
‘Chymica quaedam ex interpretatione Michaelis
Scoti dedicata Theophilo regi Scotorum. Corpus
Christi <span class="smcapuc">MS.</span> 125. In eodem codice <span class="smcapuc">MS.</span> fol. est haec
nota “Explicit tractatus magistri Michaelis Scoti
de aelchali,” huius vero tractatus, a priore diversi,
hoc tantum fol. extat.’ This account is erroneous
in several particulars. ‘Scotorum’ should be
‘Saracenorum,’ and ‘de aelchali’ is a misreading of
‘de alkimia,’ as a glance at the manuscript informs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
us. Nor is it the case that we have here to deal
with two distinct works. The last leaf, to which
Tanner more particularly refers (fol. 119, old
numeration), shows a hand of the fourteenth century,
and forms the only remainder of the original. The
rest of the manuscript (fol. 116-118) has been
supplied by a scribe of the fifteenth century, but
the whole is perfectly continuous, as appears plainly
when we notice that the first words of the original
(fol. 119 <i lang="la">recto</i>), ‘et cum siccatus,’ have also been
written by the later scribe at the bottom of page
118 <i lang="la">verso</i>.</p>

<p>In spite of the highly suspicious dedication,
‘Theophilo Regi Saracenorum,’ several reasons
incline us to regard the <cite>De Alchimia</cite> as, in substance
at least, a genuine work of Michael Scot.
To begin with, it clearly belongs to a very early
period; for, in the opening words of his preface,
the author describes alchemy as a science, noble
indeed, but as yet neglected and contemned by the
Latins (‘apud Latinos penitus denegatam’). In
the same sentence we find him referring to the
<i lang="la">secreta naturae</i>, just as Scot does in the <cite>Liber
Luminis</cite>, and declaring his purpose to furnish the
world with a commentary on it in the work he now
attempts (‘secreta naturae intelligentibus revelare’).
In the opening paragraph of the book itself he
seems to refer plainly to the <cite>Liber Luminis</cite> as a
work written by him (‘notitia de salibus vel salium
prout in aliquo libro a me translato dixi’). Nor
should we overlook the distinctly ecclesiastical tone
which is to be observed in the <cite>De Alchimia</cite>. Part
of the preface is conceived almost in the form of a
prayer, commencing thus: ‘Creator omnium rerum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
Deus qui cuncta ex nihilo condidit,’ and in at least
one passage, a well-known text of Scripture is reproduced
(‘et haec est res quae erigit de stercore
pauperem et ipsum regibus equiparat’). This style
is a noticeable characteristic of all the works of
Michael Scot.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the <cite>De Alchimia</cite> shows
several doubtful features which, on the supposition
that it came from Scot’s pen, can only have been
due to some interference with the text at a subsequent
time. Such is the dedication to Theophilus,
King of the Saracens, which we have already
noticed, and the latter part of the preface shows a
turgid passage (‘hic est puteus Salomonis et
fimi acervus, et hic est fons in quo latet anguis
cuius venenum omnia corpora interficit,’ etc.) that
strongly recalls the fancies of the later alchemy.</p>

<p>The body of the work, however, is no doubt
genuine, and offers matters of considerable interest.
The first of these is perhaps the distinction drawn
here between the greater and the lesser mystery
(magisterium) of alchemy. The former, it seems,
was the transmutation of <em>Venus</em> into the <em>Sun</em>;
that is, of copper into gold. The latter comprehended
the fixation of mercury and its transmutation
into the <em>Moon</em>, or silver.</p>

<p>We soon notice too that the author addresses
himself not, as one would at first expect, to ‘Theophilus,’
but to a certain Brother Elias (‘tibi Fratri
Helya’)—another proof, if any were needed, that
the dedication to the apocryphal King of the
Saracens was due to some other and later hand.
‘Brother Elias,’ however, was far from being a
merely imaginary personage. He was an Italian,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
born (for accounts vary) either at Bivillo near
Assisi, Cellullae or Ursaria near Cortona, or in Piedmont.
In 1211 he joined the Order of St. Francis,
then just formed, thus becoming one of its earliest
members. His history as a Franciscan was rather
an eventful one. On the death of St. Francis
in 1226 he succeeded the Founder as General of
the Order, but was deposed by the Pope in 1230
on some suspicion that he favoured schism among
his brethren. The Order re-elected him in 1236,
but he was finally removed from office by Gregory
three years later, and profited by the occasion
to join himself openly to the party of the Emperor.
For this he suffered excommunication in 1244, and
was not restored to the privileges of the Church till
1253, when he lay on his death-bed at Cortona.
There is no doubt that he had the reputation of
possessing skill in alchemy, as a treatise is extant
called the <cite>Liber Fratris Eliae de Alchimia</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> This
renown would not tend to his honour in religion.
It seems indeed to invest with a cruel and pointed
meaning the words used by the Pope on the
occasion of his first deposition.<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> He is said to have
been sent in early days on an embassy to the
Emperor of the East. Perhaps this may have been
the occasion when he first acquired a taste for those
chemical studies which that nation still pursued.
Michael Scot addresses him in the <cite>De Alchimia</cite> as a
pupil (‘Et ego, Magister Michael Scotus, sum operatus
super solem, et docui te, Fr. Elia, operari et tu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
mihi saepius retulisti te instabiliter multis viabus
operasse’), while at the same confessing that he was
not above learning some of the secrets of art from
the well-known Franciscan. This relation between
two such distinguished men has not hitherto been
noticed, and is certainly a curious point in the
history of the times.</p>

<p>The <cite>De Alchimia</cite> presents several features which
distinguish it from the <cite>Liber Luminis</cite>. One of
these is an early passage which refers to the correspondence
between the metals and the planets, and
explains that when the latter are named we must
understand that the former are intended. Near
the end of the treatise a description of the <i lang="la">materia
chemica</i> occurs, but it would seem as if this had
been written to supplement that given in the <cite>Liber
Luminis</cite>, for it deals, not with salts, alums, vitriols,
or volatile substances, but with the different
varieties of what the author calls ‘gummae,’ which,
however, are mineral substances;<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> and with ‘tuchia’
in all its various kinds.</p>

<p>Many words and phrases, however, might be
cited to show how the strain of doctrine observable
in the <cite>Liber Luminis</cite> is continued with scarcely
any change in the <cite>De Alchimia</cite>. We have
hardly read a line in the first receipt before we meet
with the expression ‘sanguinem hominis rufi’ recalling
the ‘sanguinem hominis rubei’ of the <cite>Liber
Luminis</cite>. The ‘pulvis bufonis’ indeed is here replaced
by another ingredient derived from the
animal kingdom, the ‘sanguis bubonis’; but, reading
a little further, we find the familiar ‘urina taxi’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
again recommended as an almost universal solvent
and detergent. Evidently both works proceeded
from one and the same alchemical school. The
number of Arabian chemists<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> cited in the <cite>De
Alchimia</cite> seems to show that if these books came
from a Greek source it was not that of ancient times,
but some Byzantine school that had borrowed much
from Eastern alchemists.</p>

<p>To give a substantial idea of the <cite>De Alchimia</cite>
let us translate one of the formulae which it
contains: ‘Medibibaz the Saracen of Africa used
to change lead into gold [in the following manner].
Take lead and melt it thrice with caustic (‘comburenti’),
red arsenic, sublimate of vitriol, sugar of
alum, and with that red tuchia of India which is
found on the shore of the Red Sea, and let the
whole be again and again quenched in the juice
of the <i lang="la">Portulaca marina</i>, the wild cucumber, a
solution of sal ammoniac, and the urine of a young
badger. Let all these ingredients then, when well
mixed, be set on the fire, with the addition of some
common salt, and well boiled until they be reduced
to one-third of their original bulk, when you must
proceed to distil them with care. Then take the
marchasite of gold, prepared talc, roots of coral,
some carcha-root, which is an herb very like the
<i lang="la">Portulaca marina</i>; alum of cumae something red
and saltish, Roman alum and vitriol, and let the
latter be made red; sugar of alum, Cyprus earth,
some of the red Barbary earth, for that gives a good
colour; Cumaean earth of the red sort, African<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
tuchia, which is a stone of variegated colours and
being melted with copper changeth it into gold;
Cumaean salt which is …; pure red arsenic, the
blood of a ruddy man, red tartar, <i lang="la">gumma</i> of Barbary,
which is red and worketh wonders in this art; salt
of Sardinia which is like …. Let all these be beaten
together in a brazen mortar, then sifted finely and
made into a paste with the above water. Dry this
paste, and again rub it fine on the marble slab.
Then take the lead you have prepared as directed
above, and melt it together with the powder, adding
some red alum and some more of the various salts.
This alum is found about Aleppo (‘Alapia’), and in
Armenia, and will give your metal a good colour.
When you have so done you shall see the lead
changed into the finest gold, as good as what comes
from Arabia. This have I, Michael Scot, often put
to the proof and ever found it to be true.’</p>

<p>If such a receipt is valuable as indicating the
chemical practice of those days, it is no less interesting
as it throws light upon the life and occupations
of Scot. He must have set up a complete
chemical laboratory at Toledo, with crucibles for
the melting of metals, and alembics for the distillation
of the substances which his art required
him to mix with them. His situation was one very
favourable to these pursuits, not only because Spain
was one of those countries where the doctrine of
alchemy made its greatest progress, and attracted
most powerfully the concourse of foreign adepts,
but also from the facility with which the necessary
<i lang="la">materia chemica</i> could there be procured. The
<i lang="es">sierras</i> of that country were full of mineral wealth
of all kinds, especially quicksilver, which was one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
of the substances most frequently chosen to become
the subject of the transmuter’s art. In the <i lang="es">Alpujarras</i>,
a mountainous district lying under the soft
climate of Granada, grew plenty of these rare herbs
employed in alchemy, as they were also in the
medicine of the Arabians. Ibn Beithar of Malaga
describes them in his botanical thesaurus, and
it is said that after the Moors had lost that fair
kingdom their herbalists, even as late as our
own times, made yearly journeys from Africa to
gather in these hills the plants which ancient
science taught them to value highly. But the
days of the ‘ultimo sospiro del Moro’ were yet in
the far future, and meanwhile Michael Scot in his
laboratory at Toledo could easily command all these
treasures for the purposes of experiment. Nor was
it in vain that he fanned his fires, and watched the
metals melt and the menstruum distil in the process
of the lesser or greater mystery. If he never saw
<em>Venus</em> blush into the true substance of <em>Sol</em>, or
<em>Mercury</em>, the fickle and obstinate, congeal into
a veritable <em>Luna</em>, his chemical practice, and the records
in which he has embodied it, mark none the
less true and significant a moment in the history
of scientific progress.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="smaller">THE ASTRONOMICAL WRITINGS OF SCOT</span></h2>

<p>The alchemy of the thirteenth century, to the progress
of which Michael Scot contributed not a little,
bore a close relation to the opinions then entertained
in another branch of science: that of astronomy. We
have already noticed how chemistry, as practised in
Egypt, was largely influenced by Eastern theories
regarding the stars and their power over earthly
elements. That this connection and sympathy was
still a matter of common belief at the time Scot
wrote is not only probable but can readily be
established by direct evidence. The treatise ‘Cum
studii solertis indagine,’ already referred to,<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> has a
curious passage which bears directly on the point in
question. We find in the preface the following
remarkable statement: ‘For the art of alchemy
belongs to the deeper and more hidden physics, and
in particular to that division thereof which … is
called the lower astronomy,’ It is plain then that
no chemist could in those days be considered fully
competent for the task he undertook unless to a
knowledge of the customary theories and processes
of his art he added some acquaintance with the
mysteries of the heavenly spheres as well.</p>

<p>To Michael Scot, even before he came to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
Toledo, the science of astronomy was already a
beaten path. His progress in mathematical studies
naturally led him to this, the highest sphere in
which they could be exercised. At the court of
Frederick he had made many an observation and
cast many a horoscope. In the <cite>Liber Introductorius</cite>
and <cite>Liber Particularis</cite> he had produced two
manuals expounding in a popular way the twin
sciences of astrology and astronomy; publications
which no doubt reproduced pretty exactly the
teaching he had given to the Emperor.</p>

<p>In Spain he not only kept up his interest in
this subject but lost no opportunity of improving
his past acquirements. He was constantly on the
watch for new astronomical works. He read them,
not only as a student eager to extend his knowledge,
but as a translator anxious to find the opportunity
of adding to the resources of other scholars
by the production of some important book in a
Latin dress.</p>

<p>As a resident in Toledo, Scot found himself
very favourably situated for such studies. That
city was now indeed to become what may be called
the classic ground of Moorish astronomy. A
Spanish author would have us believe that there
presently assembled there an incredible number of
astronomers drawn, not only from all parts of Spain,
but from France as well, and especially from Paris.
The king himself is said to have presided over this
congress. The works of Ptolemy, with the commentaries
of Montafan and Algazel, were translated
into Latin for the use of those scholars who
did not understand Arabic. Discussions were held
in the Alcazar of Galiana upon the various theories<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
of the heavenly bodies and their movements.
These labours, which commenced in 1218, and are
said to have lasted till 1262, resulted in a more
exact series of observations than had hitherto been
made. They were published, and became generally
known as the <cite>Tables of Toledo</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>It was in such a direction indeed that the line
of true progress lay. As alchemy rose into a real
chemistry rather by the practice of the laboratory
than by the theory of the schools, so it was with
regard to astronomy. The scheme of Ptolemy with
its various modifications necessarily held the field,
imperfect and erroneous as it was, till wider and more
exact observations, such as those for which the wise
king of Castile thus provided had, in the course
of after ages, furnished adequate ground for the
magical and illuminative speculations of Copernicus,
Galileo, and Newton.</p>

<p>Favourable, however, as Scot’s situation in
Toledo undoubtedly was, much of what we are considering
lay beyond his reach, being yet in the
womb of the future. The Moorish astronomers, and
he doubtless with them, felt far from satisfied
with the Ptolemaic system as expounded in the
<cite>Almagest</cite>. While no one as yet ventured to
interfere with its fundamental conception of the
earth as the centre of the universe, every fresh
observation, by bringing into view more of the
delicacy and subtlety of the heavenly movements,
made additions and modifications of that theory
constantly necessary. Hence arose a series of
Arabian works on the <em>sphere</em>, each superseding that
which had preceded it, and reflecting the last results<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
obtained with the astrolabe. Such a line of progress
could not but lead to the time when the
Ptolemaic theory no longer lent itself by any
modification to the full explanation of ascertained
facts. Then and then only arose the new astronomy
of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, which is
thus seen to be vitally connected, even in its highest
reach and most splendid developments with the
now forgotten theories of the Moorish schools.</p>

<p>Considering then the epoch at which he lived,
and the incomplete material which existed in his
days for a true science of the heavens, Michael Scot
did all that could be reasonably expected of him.
He sat at the feet of those who were then the best
authorities on this subject. He used his opportunities
at Toledo to make the last and most subtle
theories of the Moors intelligible to those less
fortunate scholars whose attention these must
otherwise have escaped.</p>

<p>His services to astronomy appeared in the Latin
version which he made from a treatise on the <cite>Sphere</cite>
lately composed by Alpetrongi. This author’s
name is said to have been, in its Arabic form, Nured-din
el Patrugi. Munk, in his <cite>Mélanges</cite>, tells us
that the latter designation was derived from a
village called Petroches lying a little to the north
of Cordova.<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> The Latins corrupted the name in
different ways, so that among them it became
<em>Avenalpetrandi</em>, <em>Alpetrongi</em>, or <em>Alpetragius</em>. The
astronomer who bore it flourished about the year
1190, and is said to have been a renegade, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
scholar of the celebrated Ibn Tofail, the author of
the curious Sufic romance called <cite>Hay Ibn Yokhdan</cite>.</p>

<p>In the preface to his book on the <cite>Sphere</cite> Alpetrongi
begs to be excused if he has ventured to
differ from the tradition of the ancients in his
theory of the heavenly movements, and especially
from Ptolemy the great master of this science.
His apology reminds us that it may be well to
examine more exactly than we have yet done the
various advances which had been made up to this
time by the Arabian astronomy.</p>

<p>As early as the ninth century the mathematicians
of that nation had simplified the problems
of the circle by discovering the way of measurement
by sine and tangent instead of by the chord.
This improvement is ascribed to Albategni who lived
between the years 877 and 929. Calculation was
soon made still easier by the invention of algebra.
The year 820 is given as the age of Mohammed ben
Moussa, surnamed Al Khowaresmi, who had the
honour of this important discovery. From the
surname of this mathematician the Latins afterwards
formed by corruption their common noun
<i lang="la">Algorisma</i> or <i lang="la">Algorithmus</i>, from which our word
arithmetic is derived.</p>

<p>These improved methods of calculation were
soon applied to astronomy. Al Mamun, whose reign
commenced in the year 813, summoned an assembly
of scholars learned in that science. They met in the
great Babylonian plain, having chosen that place as
suitable for their observations, and measured the declination
of the ecliptic, which they determined to be
23° 33ʺ. About the same time the secular motion of
the heavens began to attract attention. Albategni<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
corrected the observations of Ptolemy here, and
showed that the retrograde movement amounted to
one degree, not in a century as the Greek philosopher
had said, but in a shorter period which is variously
stated as sixty-six or seventy years. Alfargan repeated
this calculation, and amended that relating
to the declination of the ecliptic, which he computed
at 23° 35ʺ.</p>

<p>This was the progress and these the data which
led the Moorish astronomers to abandon the earlier
and simpler theories of the <em>sphere</em> as inconsistent
with ascertained facts. They were aware of
motions among the heavenly bodies not to be
explained by the mere supposition that round the
earth as a centre moved the concentric spheres
on the axes of their poles. It is true that
even Ptolemy himself had felt something of this
difficulty and had endeavoured to meet it by a
theory of eccentrics and epicycles. As knowledge
increased, however, this primitive explanation was
felt to be cumbrous and unsatisfactory. Aboasar<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>
and Azarchel gained fame by boldly striking out in
new paths, and later Moorish astronomers eagerly
followed the lead thus given them, each adding
some modification of his own.</p>

<p>Thus then we return to the preface of Alpetrongi
prepared to understand his position when he
declares himself obliged to depart from previous
traditions. He proceeds to avow himself a scholar
of Azarchel, but when we examine his work we find
that the theory he proposes differs considerably
even from that taught by his immediate master.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
It was one which, through the labours of Michael
Scot, as translator of Alpetrongi, exercised no small
influence on the study of astronomy among the
Latins, and we may well spend a moment in considering
the chief features which it presents.</p>

<p>One of the most important problems which
called for solution at the hands of the Moorish
astronomers was that of the recession of the
heavenly bodies, by which, when observed at
sufficient intervals of time, they were seen to fall
short of the positions they might have been
expected to reach. This recession, as we have
remarked already, had been very accurately studied,
and computed as exactly as the methods of the
time allowed; but a reason for so remarkable a
phenomenon was yet to seek. Alpetrongi boldly
declared that the eastward motion was apparent
only and not real. He explained that the source
of power lay in the <i lang="la">primum mobile</i> or ninth sphere;
that lying outside the sphere of the fixed stars.
From hence the force producing circular motion
was derived to the eighth, and so to the inferior
spheres; each handing on a part of the impulse
to that which lay beneath it. In the course of
transmission, however, the prime force became
gradually exhausted. Thus, said Alpetrongi, it
happens that each sphere moves rather more
slowly than the one above it, and so the apparent
recession is accounted for in a way which shows it
to be relative only and not absolute.</p>

<p>Another matter which exercised the minds of
those who studied the heavens was the difference
of elevation which the heavenly bodies showed
according to the seasons of summer and winter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
The sun, for example, at noonday of the summer
solstice stood, they saw, at his highest point in the
heavens, while he sank to his lowest on the shortest
day of winter. Between these extremes he held
gradually every intermediate position, and as he was
meanwhile supposed to be moving in a circular path
round the earth, his course came to be conceived of
as a spiral alternately rising and declining. How
was this spiral motion to be explained?</p>

<p>Each sphere, said Alpetrongi, has its own
poles, which differ from those of the <i lang="la">primum mobile</i>,
and thus each, while following the motion of the
ninth sphere, accomplishes at the same time
another revolution about its own proper poles.
From the combination of these two movements
arises one of the nature of a spiral which fully
accounts for the seeming deviations of the heavenly
bodies to north or south.<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p>Such were the contributions of this philosopher
to the astronomy of his time. They were the fruit,
he assures us, of patient study of the ancients, and
specially of Aristotle and his commentators. He
offered them to his age as a distinct improvement
on the cumbrous theories of Ptolemy, and as an
advance even upon that of Azarchel, whom, in
the main, he acknowledges as his master in science.
Antiquated and childish as his explanations may
seem to us, we cannot help feeling that he had at
least grasped firmly some of the chief problems of
the sky. He stood in the line of that inquiry
and patient progress which have issued in the marvellous
discoveries of later times.</p>

<p>Scot’s version of the <cite>Sphere</cite> of Alpetrongi has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
reached us accompanied by the date of its composition;
a distinction which belongs to only one
other among his translations, that of the <cite>Abbreviatio
Avicennae</cite>. M. Jourdain had the merit of being
the first who drew attention to this fortunate
circumstance,<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> and he did so by quoting the colophons
of two manuscripts of the <cite>Sphere</cite> discovered
by him in the Paris library.<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> One of these closes
thus: ‘Praised be Jesus Christ who liveth for ever
throughout all time:<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> on the eighteenth day of August,
being Friday, at the third hour, <i lang="la">cum aboleolente</i>,<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>
in the year one thousand two hundred and fifty-five.’
The other gives the date thus: ‘The year of
the Incarnation of Christ twelve hundred and
seventeen.’ These two epochs coincide exactly, as
the apparent difference arises from the date being
expressed in the first manuscript according to the
era of Spain. It is therefore doubly certain that
Scot’s version of the <cite>Sphere</cite> of Alpetrongi was made
in the year 1217.<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<p>In completing this translation Michael Scot
anticipated by one year only the great astronomical
congress which the King of Castile presently
caused to assemble at Toledo. It may very possibly
therefore have been one of the versions prepared
with a view to this great occasion and designed for
the use of the Latin astronomers who might come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
there. Certain it is that the author was not less
fortunate in this than in his previous literary
ventures. The text was well chosen, the time of
publication opportune, and the <cite>Sphere</cite> of Alpetrongi
as it came from Scot’s hand had a wide circulation
and influenced profoundly the astronomical beliefs
of the day.<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<span class="smaller">SCOT TRANSLATES AVERROËS</span></h2>

<p>We have already noticed how the commentaries of
Avicenna on Aristotle had been translated into
Latin at Toledo during the twelfth century, and
how Michael Scot had completed that work by his
version of the books relating to Natural History.
Since the beginning of the thirteenth century, however,
another Arabian author of the first rank had
become the object of much curiosity in Europe.
This was the famous Averroës of Cordova, whose
history might fill a volume, so full was it of romantic
adventure and literary interest.<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> He was but lately
dead, having closed a long and laborious life on the
10th of December 1198, at Morocco, where his body
was first laid to rest in the cemetery outside the
gate of Tagazout. Born at Cordova in 1126, his
name was closely associated with that of his native
city, so that after three months had elapsed his
corpse was brought thither from Africa, and given
honourable and final burial in the tomb of his fathers
at the cemetery of Ibn Abbas.</p>

<p>Two reasons combined to raise the fame of
Averroës among the Latins, and to inspire them
with a high curiosity regarding his works. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
known to have devoted his life to the study and
exposition of Aristotle; then, as for many ages, the
idol of the Christian schools. His philosophy was
further understood to embody the strangest and
most daring speculations regarding the origin of the
universe and the nature of the soul. For these he
had suffered severely at the hands of the Moslem
orthodox. They had proscribed his works and compelled
him to leave his employment and pass the
most precious years of his life in exile.</p>

<p>These common impressions regarding Averroës
were in the main correct. His labours had appeared
in three forms; a paraphrase, and a lesser and
greater commentary on the books of Aristotle, and
the philosophy which these writings contained was
undoubtedly Manichæan, if not in a measure Pantheistic.
Like that of all the Arabian philosophers,
to whose teaching Averroës gave its final and most
characteristic form, this doctrine was really Greek:
the Aristotelic scheme of the universe as it had been
conceived anew by Porphyry of Alexandria. At
the foundation lay a mighty Duality: that of the
opposing powers of Good and Evil. With the
notion of exalting Him above the possibility of
blame, God, the Centre of the Universe, about
whom all revolves, was declared to be the Absolute
and unconditional Being; while over against Him
was set Matter, also eternal, from which, in its
stubborn resistance to the Divine Will, all evil had
arisen. Any direct action of Deity upon matter
could not be thought of; so the interval between
them was conceived of as occupied by several
Emanations proceeding from God, among which we
may notice those of the Divine Wisdom and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
Divine Power. This Wisdom was said to be impersonal;
one common to all intelligent creatures;
the Light that lighteneth every man that cometh
into the world. This Power was regarded as
supreme, seated high above the spheres, and,
through the <i lang="la">Primum Mobile</i>, entering into touch
with matter and deriving its force downward from
one heavenly circle to another till it reaches earth
itself.</p>

<p>The origin of created beings was a problem
which received much attention from Averroës. His
ideas on this subject will be seen when we come to
speak of the important digression he wrote under
the title of <cite>Quaestiones Nicolai Peripatetici</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> In
every man he perceived the existence of a passive
intellect or reason, in relation to which the other
Heavenly Intelligence, or Divine Wisdom, presented
itself to him as the Active Reason: that in whose
motions Thought was always accompanied by Power.
The one was Impersonal and Eternal, the other
individual and perishable, yet Averroës taught that
a close relation subsisted between them, and a consequent
sympathy and attraction, in which the
passive intelligence strove to unite itself with the
active and thus achieve eternity and immortality.<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p>This union was known as the <i>ittisal</i>: the supreme
object of the wise man’s desire, and in connection
with it emerged for the first time a distinction between
Averroës and his predecessors. Ibn Badja,
with whom he held the closest relation, had proposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
a course of moral discipline as the best way
of attaining the <i>ittisal</i>: the same ascetic practice
which Ibn Tofail so remarkably illustrated and commended
in his mystical romance <cite>Hay Ibn Yokhdan</cite>.
Gazzali on the other hand, who was the sceptic of
these schools, boldly declared that the <i>ittisal</i> was
only to be reached by an intellectual and spiritual
confusion attained in the <i>zikr</i>, or whirling dance of
the Dervishes. It was left then for Averroës to
vindicate once more the validity of human reason,
and this he did by proclaiming that science, rightly
understood, was the true way of entering into intellectual
communion with the Deity. All, however,
agreed in teaching that the soul of man was but
an individual and temporary manifestation of the
Divine, from which it had proceeded, and into
which it would again be absorbed.</p>

<p>It is plain that the way to this consummation
proposed by Averroës had much in common with
the ancient theories of the Alexandrian Gnosis.
The Albigenses and other sects of the time,
especially that called the Brotherhood of the Holy
Ghost, had already done much to familiarise the
West with these essentially Eastern speculations.
A taste for such flights of the mind had been
formed, and, as soon as it became known that a
new teacher had arisen to advocate a theory of this
kind among the Moors, Christianity too was alive
with curiosity to know what the doctrine of Averroës
might be.</p>

<p>In these circumstances the anathema of the
Church proved powerless to restrain so strong an
impulse of the human spirit. The Council of Paris
in 1209 had sounded the first note of warning and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
of censure. In 1215 Robert de Courçon published
a statute in that university by which the name of
<em>Mauritius Hispanus</em>, understood by Renan to mean
Averroës, was associated with those of David of
Dinant and Almaric of Bena the French Pantheists
of the day, and all men were warned to have nothing
to do with their writings under pain of censure. In
spite of these enactments five years had not passed
since the date of the latter proclamation, before the
commentaries of Averroës were rendered into Latin
and the secrets of his remarkable philosophy laid
open to the scholastic world.</p>

<p>The credit of this bold and successful enterprise
belongs, it would be hard to say in what
proportions, to the Emperor Frederick <span class="smcapuc">II.</span> and to
Michael Scot his faithful servant. Frederick had
indeed every reason to feel an interest in the works
of Averroës. His mind was naturally keen and of
a speculative cast. He showed little inclination to
subject his curiosity to the restraints of custom or
ecclesiastical authority, and was thus at least as
likely as any of the wise and noble of his day to
indulge his passion for what promised to be both
original and curious. We are to remember also
that he stood in close relation with the peculiar
religious opinions already noticed, which were then
so prevalent both in south-eastern France and the
adjoining parts of Spain. His brother-in-law, who
died so suddenly at Palermo, was Count of
Provence, and, whatever place the unfortunate
Alphonso may have held with regard to the heresy
so common in his dominions, we may feel sure that
among the host of Provençal knights who formed
his train when he came to Sicily there must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
have been some at least who were adherents of
the Albigensian party. No religious opinion ever
made so striking a progress among the wealthy and
noble as this, and none was ever commended in a
way more fit to win the sympathy and interest of a
youthful monarch inclined to letters and gallantry.
The doctrine of the Albigenses was in fact a late
revival of the <em>Gnosis</em> of Alexandria. It flattered
the pride of those who desired distinction even in
their religion. Its representatives and advocates
were no repulsive monks or sour ascetics but men
of birth and breeding, who excelled in manly
exercises, and were famous for their success in the
courts of love and in the <em>gay saber</em>. It would not
have been wonderful if Frederick himself had
become an Albigensian. He is known to have
caught a taste for Provençal poetry if nothing
more, and it is certain that he remained, to the
close of his life, and even beyond it, a grateful
and sympathetic figure among those who, after the
great persecution, still represented Albigensian
doctrine.<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> Something of this may have been due
to the influence of his wife Constantia, whose father,
Don Pedro of Aragon, had fallen gallantly in 1213
under the walls of Murel, during an expedition in
which he led the Spanish chivalry to aid the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
Counts of Toulouse and Foix the champions of the
Albigensian party.</p>

<p>The probability that the Emperor had early felt
an interest in Averroës is confirmed by a curious
statement of Gilles de Rome,<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> who tells us that the
sons of the Moorish philosopher received a cordial
welcome from Frederick and lived in honour at his
Court. Renan indeed finds reason to doubt the
truth of this statement,<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> yet we may remember
that the chronicler could not in any case have
ventured upon it unless the Emperor’s sympathy
for Averroës had been matter of common knowledge.</p>

<p>As to Michael Scot we may feel sure that he
was every whit as eager as his master could be to
honour the philosopher’s memory and to gain a
nearer acquaintance with his writings. The manuscript
in the Laurentian library to which we have
already referred<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> speaks, it will be remembered, of a
visit paid by Scot to the city of Cordova. It is not
difficult to determine with a high degree of probability
the reason that may have led him thither.
Had he lived three hundred years earlier indeed,
the fame of Cordova as a centre of learning might
well have proved a sufficient attraction to account
for this journey. In the tenth century that city
shone as the seat of a great Jewish school: one of
those lately transferred to Spain from the eastern
cities of Pombeditha and Sura. The Caliph Hakim,
under whose protection this change took place,
gave royal encouragement to the learned men who
came to Cordova. Thousands of students assembled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
in the great Mosque, and Hakim collected for their use
a magnificent library which was said to contain four
hundred thousand volumes. Al Mansour, however,
who succeeded to Hakim’s throne, fell under the
influence of orthodox scruples. He burnt much
of the great library, and the rest perished at the
disastrous sack of Cordova in the following century.
The ruin of the Rabbinical academies was completed
a little later by the cruel edict of Abd-el-Mumen,
who expelled the Jews from his realm.
The most famous teachers of Cordova and Lucena
then betook themselves to Castile. Alphonso <span class="smcapuc">VII.</span> received
them kindly and gave them liberty to settle
in his capital. These events took place before 1150,
and from that date the ancient schools which had
given such fame to Cordova and Lucena became
one of the chief attractions of Toledo.</p>

<p>The sole glory which Cordova still retained in
the days when Scot visited it was the memory of
departed greatness, and of Averroës, whose fame
must yet have endured as a living tradition in the
place of his birth and burial. We may therefore
believe that it was as a pilgrim to the shrine of that
illustrious name that the traveller came hither.
As he wandered amid the countless columns of the
great Mosque, or stayed his steps by the tomb of
Ibn Abbas, he must have found a melancholy
pleasure in recalling the mighty past, when these
aisles were crowded with eager students and when,
still later, the last scion of the Cordovan schools had
appeared in the person of the Master whose writings
were now the object of so much curiosity. It
is quite possible that something of a practical
purpose may have combined with these sentiments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
to determine the direction of Scot’s journey.
Twenty years had not passed, we must remember,
since the body of Averroës was laid in its last
resting-place. What if those who directed and
composed the solemn funeral procession from
Morocco to Cordova had brought with them the
books which the philosopher was engaged in completing
at the time of his death? The hope of a
great literary discovery could hardly have been
absent from the mind of Michael Scot as he travelled
southward to seek the white walls of the Moorish
city.<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>

<p>There is no reason to think that the story of
the spell framed by Scot at Cordova was literally
and historically true; it seems to belong rather to
the department of his legendary fame as a necromancer.
Yet, read as a parable, this conjuration is
not without interest and perhaps importance. It
professes to compel the appearance of spirits from
the nether deep, and to command an answer to
any question the sage or student might choose to
ask. A slight effort of fancy will find here the
picturesque representation of Scot’s mental and
physical state while at Cordova, and especially under
the stress of the illness from which we are assured
he then suffered.<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> What wonder if, in the vertigo
of fever, he felt prisoned with swimming brain in
magic circles; or is it strange that one so intent
upon the doctrine of the departed Averroës should,
in the height of his delirium, have planned to force<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
the grave itself, and summon the dead philosopher
to tell the secret of his lost works? Something of
the Greek δεινότης, something terrible, superhuman
almost, we discover in a spirit so fully roused and
determined, and if we have read rightly the mind
of Scot, no wonder that he and the Emperor were
fully at one in regard to what they had to do. We
have no means of knowing which of the two first
conceived the idea of translating the works of
Averroës: as master and servant they fairly share
the fame of that great enterprise. It was one
which demanded, not only means, talent, and
unwearied labour, but high courage as well, considering
the suspect character of that philosophy
and the censures under which it already lay. In
the event indeed this proved to be a matter
highly creditable to those who promoted it, but
one which carried serious and far-reaching consequences
both for Michael Scot and for the
Emperor himself in the ecclesiastical and political
sphere.</p>

<p>When Scot returned to Toledo it was not with
the purpose of attempting single-handed a task for
which not only time, but the co-operation of several
scholars, was evidently necessary. There is reason
to think that the Emperors commission conveyed
some instruction to this effect; for, as a matter of
fact, we know that at least two other hands were
associated with Scot in the translation of Averroës.</p>

<p>One of these was Gerard of Cremona, not of
course the Cremonese who died in 1187, but the
younger scholar of the same name, perhaps a son
or nephew of the elder. He is distinguished as
Gherardus <em>de Sabloneta</em> Cremonensis. The Victorine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
manuscript<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> supplies evidence that he contributed to
the work in which Michael Scot was now engaged.</p>

<p>It is not impossible that Philip of Tripoli may
have joined in the new enterprise. His name does
not indeed appear in any of the manuscripts which
contain the Latin Averroës, but we have seen that
he was certainly in Spain about this time and even
at work with Gerard of Cremona.<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> His intimate
relation to Michael Scot is also beyond question,
and, upon the whole, it seems reasonable to suppose
that the Emperor may have engaged him to help in
the work now going forward.</p>

<p>However this may have been as regards the
exact details of time and persons, we may regard it
as a matter now for the first time brought to light
and established, that in the years between 1217
and 1223 there existed a college of translators in
Toledo just such as that which had done so much
excellent work there a century before. In the new
school Frederick <span class="smcapuc">II.</span> held the honourable place of
patron, as Archbishop Raymon had done in his
day, while Michael Scot and Gerard of Cremona
aided each other in completing the version of
Averroës as Dominicus Gundisalvus had lent his
help to form that of Avicenna. This view of the
matter should be found very interesting, not only
in itself, but with regard to the conclusions arrived
at by Jourdain, whose discoveries in the literary
history of the twelfth century it so remarkably
repeats and extends to the following age.</p>

<p>This correspondence between the earlier and
later schools of Toledo is even more close and exact
than we have yet observed. It appears also in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
fact that a Jewish interpreter was attached to each,
and rendered important service as a member of the
college. Under Don Raymon this place was held
by Johannes Avendeath, or Johannes Hispalensis
as he is commonly called, who worked along with
the Archdeacon. ‘You have then,’ says Avendeath,
addressing the Archbishop, ‘the book which has
been translated from the Arabic according to your
commands: I reading it word by word into the
vernacular (Spanish), and Dominic the Archdeacon
rendering my words one by one into Latin.’<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> The
same division of labour seems to have been followed
in the new school which Frederick promoted. The
Emperor drew the attention of these learned men to
Averroës, and signified his desire that a version of
this author should be prepared like that which had
been made from Avicenna. Michael Scot and Gerard
of Cremona were responsible, the former probably in
a special sense, both for the general conduct of the
undertaking, and, in particular, for the accuracy of
the Latin. Now these scholars also, like their
predecessors, availed themselves of the help of a
Jewish interpreter. This was one Andrew Alphagirus,
who seems to have taken the same part that
Avendeath had formerly done, by translating the
Arabic of Averroës into current Spanish, which Scot
and his coadjutor then rendered into Latin.</p>

<p>Such at least appear to be the suggestions
which offer themselves naturally to one who peruses
the colophon to the copy of the <cite>De Animalibus
ad Caesarem</cite> preserved in the <cite>Bibliotheca Angelica</cite><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
of Rome. Thus it runs: ‘Here endeth the book
of Aristotle concerning animals, according to the
abbreviation of Michael Scot Alphagirus.’ The
form of expression is curious, but may be exactly
matched from the versions produced by the earlier
Toledan translators: that is, if we are to believe
Bartolocci. This author, in the first volume of his
<cite>Bibliotheca Rabbinica</cite>, mentions a manuscript of the
Fondo Urbinate in the Vatican which, he says, contains
the four books of Avicenna on Physics
translated by ‘Johannes Gundisalvi.’ This name
has evidently, like that of ‘Scoti Alphagiri,’ been
formed by composition from those of the two
translators, <em>Johannes</em> Avendeath and Dominicus
<em>Gundisalvi</em> who aided each other in the work.<a name="FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>

<p>As to the personality of Alphagirus, the only
ground of conjecture seems to be that supplied by
Romanus de Higuera, who, speaking of the learned
men assembled in 1218 at Toledo for the astronomical
congress, mentions that one of them was
‘el Conhesso Alfaquir’ of Toledo.<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> The place, the
date, and the similarity of name, are all in favour
of our supposing these two to be one and the same
person. Nay further, as Alfaquir was of Toledo,
and did not need to be summoned thither in 1218,
there is no reason why he should not, as the
‘Alphagirus’ of 1209, have assisted Michael Scot in
producing the <cite>De Animalibus</cite> for Frederick.</p>

<p>It is from a remark made by Roger Bacon that
we know the first name of the Toledan interpreter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
to have been Andrew, and that he was a Jew.
Bacon gives us this information in no kindly spirit,
but in order to lead up to the bitter conclusion
that Scot’s work was not original, but borrowed
from one whose labours and just fame he had
appropriated. ‘Michael Scot,’ he says, ‘was ignorant
of languages and science alike. Almost all
that has appeared in his name was taken from a
certain Jew called Andrew.’<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

<p>A sufficient answer to this serious accusation
may be found in what we already know of the
literary fashions of the day, and, in particular, of
the traditional methods of work pursued by the
Toledan translators. It was precisely thus that
the Archdeacon Gundisalvus had used the aid of
Avendeath. A little later too, we find the same
system adopted in the translation of the Koran
promoted by Peter the Venerable. That ecclesiastic
thus expresses himself in sending a copy of his book
to St. Bernard: ‘I had it translated by one skilled
in both tongues; Master Peter of Toledo; but since
he was not as much at home in the Latin, and did
not know it as well as the Arabic, I appointed one
to help him … Brother Peter our Notary.’ To
his Koran Peter the Venerable joined a <cite>Summa
Brevis</cite> of the Christian controversy with the Mohammedans.
This work also came from the pen of
Master Peter, and with regard to it he makes the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
following remarks: ‘By giving elegance and order
to what had been rudely and confusedly stated by
him (<i lang="la">i.e.</i> by Master Peter) he (<i lang="la">i.e.</i> Brother Peter
the Notary) has completed an epistle, or rather a
short treatise, which, as I believe, will be very useful
to many.’<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p>

<p>This correspondence throws a clear light upon
the case of Michael Scot in regard to the charge of
plagiarism. Like Master Peter, he was familiar with
both the Latin and the Arabic language. His weak
point, however, we may suppose to have made itself
felt with regard to the latter, which he probably
knew better in its colloquial than its literary
form, and this must have been the reason why
he availed himself of the aid of a Spanish Jew
to secure the accuracy of his work. Such collaboration
seems to have produced nearly all the
previous versions which came from Toledo, and it
is obvious that the honour due to the various contributors
who combined in forming these translations
can only be determined by those who have
it in their power to make a careful and unprejudiced
valuation of their individual labours in each case.
We may gravely doubt whether this was what
Bacon did before he sat down to pen his sharp
censure on Michael Scot. Certainly such an
estimate is now out of the question. We can only
affirm the undoubted fact that the critic was wrong
when he said Scot did not know Arabic. The
contrary appears, not only from the probability we
have already drawn from his Sicilian residence, but
by actual testimony of a very honourable kind.<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
Nor must we forget to notice that the openness
with which this copartnery was carried on affords a
proof that no deceit could have been thought of in
the matter. Considering the past history of the
Toledan School, it must have been taken for
granted that every version which came from thence
under the name of a Christian scholar owed something
to the care of his Moorish scribe.</p>

<p>Even had we not been able to make such an
appeal to the use and wont of the times in vindication
of Scot’s method of work, might not a little
consideration of what was natural and inevitable
in such a task have served to explain what Bacon
found so objectionable? The scholars from distant
lands who came to Toledo could not, as a rule,
afford to spend much time there, and were anxious
to use every moment of their stay to the best
advantage. They naturally therefore secured on
their arrival the services of a Jew or Moor for the
purpose of learning Arabic. Needing a knowledge
of that tongue not so much in its colloquial as its
literary dialect, they must have been engaged from
the first in the study of a text rather than in conversing
with their teachers. What then could
have been more suitable than that these scholars
should begin by attacking the very books of which
they desired to furnish a Latin version? This
method had the merit of gaining two objects at
once. The students learned to read Arabic, following
the text as it was translated to them by the
interpreter. Writing in Latin from his vernacular,
and polishing as they wrote, they engaged from
the day of their arrival in the very work of translation
which had brought them to Spain. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
plain too that any modification of this method
which the case of Michael Scot might demand would
depend on the knowledge of Arabic he already
possessed. It must therefore have been such as left
him more and not less credit in the result of his
labours than that which commonly belonged to the
Christian translators in Toledo.</p>

<p>The whole matter of these versions, and of the
fame belonging to Michael Scot in connection with
them, seems to receive some further light when
we compare the Toledan practice with that which
distinguished the most famous schools of painting.
It would surely be a strange freak of criticism
which should deny to any of the great masters his
well-earned fame because of the ground on which
it was raised, or the numerous scholars whom it
attracted to his studio. Yet we know well what
this relation between the master and his school
implied in the palmy days of pictorial art. There
were apprentices who stretched canvas, mixed
colours, and pricked and pounced designs. There
were pupils, to whom, according to their talents
and proficiency, varied parts of the execution
were assigned. To the master alone belonged
the oversight and responsibility of the whole.
Giving a general design, were it only in a sketch
from his hand, he watched the progress of the
work with jealous eye, and caught the decisive
moment to interpose by executing with his own
pencil such parts of the painting as might give a
distinctive character, a <i lang="fr">cachet</i>, to the whole. Not
till he was satisfied that the desired effect had been
secured might the picture leave his studio, and who
shall say that he did wrong to sign his name to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
works produced in such a way? Thus, at any rate,
have the highest reputations in the world of art
risen into their deserved and enduring fame.</p>

<p>Now, as it is certain that the Toledan School
pursued similar methods in their literary labours,
right requires that the reputation of its members
should be judged by the same canons of criticism
which we apply without hesitation to pictorial art.
His own day unhesitatingly gave Scot the chief
credit in the version of Averroës without inquiring
too curiously what parts had been executed by
the Cremonese, or other scholars, and what share
belonged to Andrew the Jew. It may make us
the more ready to accept this verdict and adopt it
as our own when we remember the intellectual
qualities of the Emperor for whom this work was
done. It is certainly out of the question to suppose
that a reputation in letters, such as Michael Scot
undoubtedly enjoyed at the court of Frederick <span class="smcapuc">II.</span>,
could have been gained by any but legitimate and
honourable means.</p>

<p>Coming to an examination then of the various
versions which came from the new Toledan School,
we find that two of them expressly bear to have
been the work of Scot himself. The first of these
is the treatise commencing ‘Maxima cognitio
naturae et scientiae.’ It is the commentary of
Averroës on the <cite>De Coelo et Mundo</cite> of Aristotle,<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> and
Scot has prefaced it by an introduction conceived
as follows: ‘To thee, Stephen de Pruvino, I,
Michael Scot, specially commend this work, which
I have rendered into Latin from the sayings of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
Aristotle. And should Aristotle have delivered
somewhat in an incomplete form concerning the
fabric of the world in this book, thou mayest have
what is wanting to complete it from that of
Alpetragius which I have likewise rendered into
Latin; and, indeed, it is one with which thou art
well acquainted.’ As we know when the version
of Alpetrongi on the <cite>Sphere</cite> was produced, this
fortunate reference to that previous work enables
us to determine, at least approximately, that of
the <cite>De Coelo et Mundo</cite>, and hence of these translations
of Averroës in general. The year 1217 is the
first limit, before which they cannot have appeared,
and 1223 is the last; for by that time Michael Scot
had already left Spain. Between these two dates
then, and probably nearer the former than the
latter, must his labours and those of his coadjutors
have been devoted to this important work.</p>

<p>Stephanus de Provino has been happily identified
by M. Bourquelot with a somewhat notable
ecclesiastic of the Church of Nôtre Dame du Val
de Provins, whose name occurs in various documents
dated between the years 1211 and 1233. Renan
conjectures that he may be the same as a certain
Etienne de Rheims, who, it seems, was born at
Provins.<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> Perhaps he is the <cite>Stephanus Francigena</cite>
of Guido Bonatti.<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> Scot’s friendship with him, to
which the dedication of the <cite>De Coelo et Mundo</cite>
bears witness, was probably begun in their student
days at Paris.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>The second version bearing the name of Scot is
that which commences with the words: ‘Intendit
per subtilitatem demonstrare;’ being the commentary
of Averroës on the <cite>De Anima</cite> of Aristotle.<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>
In the Victorine manuscript this treatise offers a
curious title: ‘Here beginneth the Commentary of
the Book of Aristotle the Philosopher concerning
the Soul, which Averroës commented on in <em>Greek</em>,
and Michael Scot translated into Latin.’</p>

<p>In the same manuscript the version of Averroës’s
Commentary on the various books which compose
the <cite>Parva Naturalia</cite> of Aristotle is ascribed to
Gerard of Cremona. Renan observes that this
ascription does not occur in any other copy, and
supposes it to have been a mistake. He seems
influenced in this conclusion by the fact that
Gerard of Cremona died in 1187. It is curious to
find such an eminent scholar forgetful of the
existence of a younger Cremonese; and he is not
alone in this error, for it has been repeated even
of late years. Yet in 1851 Prince Baldassare
Boncompagni had distinguished well between the
elder and younger Gerard of Cremona in an excellent
monograph on the subject.<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> Even had this
work not been published, the learned world had
already reason enough to suspect the truth. In a
well-known passage of his <cite>Compendium Studii</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
Roger Bacon speaks of Gerard of Cremona as a
contemporary of Michael Scot, Alured of England,
William the Fleming, and Herman the German,
adding that those who were still young had nevertheless
known Gerard, who was the eldest of this
company of scholars. Now the <cite>Compendium Studii</cite>
is commonly assigned to the year 1292, but even
if we carry this passage back to 1267, when the
most of Bacon’s works were written, it still appears
evidently impossible that any one still young in
that year could have seen a man who died in
1187. Boncompagni, as we have said, explains the
difficulty by acquainting us with the younger
Gerard, called <em>de Sabloneta</em> Cremonensis. He was
undoubtedly a contemporary of Michael Scot, and
the De Rossi manuscript, already referred to,<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> shows
that he was in Spain about this time. There is
therefore no reason to distrust the testimony of the
Victorine codex when it gives Gerard the honour
of having translated Averroës on the <cite>Parva Naturalia</cite>.
In accomplishing this work he vindicated
his right to the place we have already ventured to
assign him as a member of the Toledan College.</p>

<p>The manuscript collections where the <cite>De Coelo et
Mundo</cite>, the <cite>De Anima</cite>, and the <cite>Parva Naturalia</cite>
of Averroës are found in a Latin dress, contain also
versions of several other commentaries by the same
author: those concerning the <cite>De Generatione et
Corruptione</cite>, the four books of the <cite>Meteora</cite>, the <cite>De
Substantia Orbis</cite>, and the <cite>Physica</cite> and <cite>Metaphysica</cite>
of Aristotle.<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> We may safely ascribe them to the
Toledo College. They were translated either by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
Michael Scot, Gerard of Cremona, or some other
scholar who worked under these masters.</p>

<p>Renan, relying on the authority of Haureau,<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a>
has shown good reason to believe that at least the
commentaries on the <cite>Physica</cite> and <cite>Metaphysica</cite> in
their Latin versions came from the pen of Scot.
Albertus Magnus, in a passage of high censure,
delivers himself in the following terms: ‘Vile
opinions are to be found in the book called
<cite>Quaestiones Nicolai Peripatetici</cite>. I have been wont
to say that the author of it was not Nicholas but
Michael Scot, who in very deed knew not natural
philosophy, nor rightly understood the books of
Aristotle.’<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> The doctrine thus condemned is undoubtedly
that of Averroës on the <cite>Physica</cite> and
<cite>Metaphysica</cite>. A manuscript of the Paris library has
a treatise commencing thus: ‘Haec sunt extracta
de libro Nicolai Peripatetici,’ and it seems that a
close correspondence exists between this and a
certain digression in the commentary by Averroës
on the twelfth book of the Metaphysics. This
digression, says Renan, often occurs in the manuscripts
as a separate treatise called ‘Sermo de
quaestionibus quas accepimus a Nicolao et nos
dicemus in his secundum nostrum posse.’ These
words have been omitted from the printed editions
of the Commentaries of Averroës, and thus the
identity of this treatise with the book censured by
Albertus Magnus was not recognised till Haureau
discovered it.</p>

<p>The only result then of this sharp criticism is to
assure us that the versions of the <cite>Physica</cite> and
<cite>Metaphysica</cite> must also be reckoned to the credit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
of Michael Scot. For undoubtedly the opinions to
which Albert took such exception were those of
Averroës, and not of the translator. But if so,
then what becomes of the censure passed upon
Scot? The truth is that if he was more original
than Bacon gave him credit for, on the other hand
he escapes the force of Albert’s blame by proving
to have been less original than the latter critic had
supposed. His was indeed a hard case. He could
not form versions from the Arabic but either he
was accused of plagiarism or else held up to the
indignation of Christianity as if he had been the
author of the opinions he rendered into Latin.
This steady determination to find fault overreaches
itself. We begin to discover in it the bitter fruit
of some <i lang="la">odium philosophicum</i>, and of that envy
which even a just reputation seldom fails to excite.</p>

<p>Some curiosity may be felt with regard to the
doctrine contained in the <cite>Quaestiones Nicolai Peripatetici</cite>
which gave ground for such adverse opinions.
M. Renan’s <i lang="fr">résumé</i> of this treatise is clear and
sufficient,<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> and we may reproduce it here, as it will
afford a useful supplement to the account already
given of the philosophy of Averroës. ‘As to the
origin of the different kinds of being,’ says Averroës,
‘there are two exactly opposite opinions, as well as
others occupying an intermediate position. The
one explains the world by a theory of development,
the other by creation. Those who hold the former
say that generation is nothing but the outcome and
in a sense the multiplication of being; the Agent,
according to this hypothesis, doing no more than
extricate being from being and make a distinction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
between them,<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> so that the Agent, thus conceived,
has the function of a mere motive power. As to
those who hold the hypothesis of creation, they say
that the Agent produces being without having any
recourse to pre-existent matter. This is the view
taken by our <em>Motecallemin</em>, and by the followers of
the Christian religion: for example, by Johannes
Christianus (Philopon), who asserts that the possibility
of creation lies in the Agent alone.’</p>

<p>‘The intermediate views may be reduced to two
only, though the first of these admits several
subdivisions which show considerable differences.
These opinions agree in affirming that generation is
only a change of substance; that all generation
implies a subject; and that everything begets in its
own likeness. The first opinion asserts, however,
that the part of the Agent is to create form, and to
impress it upon already existent matter. Some of
those who hold this view, as Ibn Sina,<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> make an
entire separation between matter in generation and
the Agent, calling the latter the <em>source of form</em>,
while others, among whom we may notice Themistius
and perhaps Alfarabi, maintain that the Agent is
in some cases conjoined with matter, as when fire
produces fire, or man begets man; and in others
separate from it, as in the generation of creeping
things and plants, <i lang="la">i.e.</i> those not produced from
seed,<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> which all owe their being to causes that are
unlike themselves.’</p>

<p>‘The third theory is that of Aristotle, who
holds that the Agent produces at once both form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
and substance, by impressing motion on matter, and
begetting a change therein which rouses its latent
powers to action. In this way of thinking the
function of the Agent is only to make active that
which already existed potentially, and to realise a
union between matter and form. Thus all creation
is reduced to motion of which heat is the principle.
This heat, shed abroad in the waters and in the
earth, begets both the animals and the plants
which are not produced by seed. Nature puts forth
all these both orderly and with perfection, just as
if guided by a controlling mind; though nature
itself has no intelligence. The proportions and
productive power which the elements owe to the
motion of the sun and stars are what Plato called
by the name of <em>Ideas</em>. According to Aristotle the
Agent cannot create forms, for in that case something
would be produced from nothing.</p>

<p>‘It is, in fact, the notion that forms could be
created which has led some philosophers to suppose
that forms have a substantive existence of their
own, and that there is a separate source of these.
The same error has infected all the three religions
of our day,<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> leading their divines to assert that
nothing can produce something. Starting from
this principle our theologians have supposed the
existence of one Agent producing without intermediary
all kinds of creatures; an Agent whose
action proceeds by an infinity of opposite and contradictory
acts done simultaneously. In this way
of thinking it is not fire that burns, nor water that
moistens; all proceeds by a direct act of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
Creator. Nay more, when a man throws a stone,
these teachers attribute the consequent motion not
to the man but to the universal Agent, and thus
deny any true human activity.</p>

<p>‘There is even a more astounding corollary of
this doctrine; for if God can cause that which is
not to enter into being, He can also reduce being
to nothing; destruction, like generation, is God’s
work, and Death itself has been created by
Him. But in our way of thinking destruction is
like generation. Each created thing contains in
itself its own corruption, which is present with it
potentially. In order to destroy, just as to create,
it is only necessary for the Agent to call this
potentiality into activity. We must in short
maintain as co-ordinate principles both the Agent
and these potential powers. Were one of the
two wanting, nothing could exist at all, or else
all being would reduce itself to action; either of
which consequences is as absurd as the other.’</p>

<p>We cannot wonder that Albertus Magnus, and
all who held the Christian faith, were alarmed by
doctrine of this kind and fiercely opposed it. The
orthodox beliefs of Christians, Jews, and Mohammedans
alike were declared false by this bold
writer, whom several expressions which we have
embodied in the above summary show clearly to
have been Averroës, and not Michael Scot. In one
passage indeed we seem to discover what may
have suggested the widely spread fable that
Frederick <span class="smcapuc">II.</span>, or Scot, or some other of their
company and party, had produced an atheistic
work called <cite>De Tribus Impostoribus</cite>. The imputation
was a false one, yet most natural were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
the feelings of prejudice which the publication of
this philosophy aroused against the great Emperor
and Michael Scot who had acted as his agent in the
matter.</p>

<p>Pursuing our investigation of the works which
came from the Toledan College we discover that these
were not confined to the books of Aristotle already
noticed, but that the translators took a wider range
in their labours. The Venice manuscript of Averroës,<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>
besides the <cite>De Coelo et Mundo</cite>, the <cite>De Anima</cite>,
the <cite>Meteora</cite>, the <cite>De Substantia Orbis</cite>, the <cite>De
Generatione et Corruptione</cite>, and the <cite>Parva Naturalia</cite>,
contains several other treatises that deserve
attention. Two of these were compositions of
Averroës; the one a commentary on the book of
Proclus, <cite>De Causis</cite>, then commonly ascribed to
Aristotle,<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> and the other an independent work, as
it would seem, bearing the following title:
‘Qualiter intellectus naturalis conjungitur Intelligentiae
abstractae,’ in short a treatise on the <i>ittisal</i>.
The volume also contains the Latin version of a
book by the Rabbi Moses Maimonides, entitled
‘De Deo Benedicto, quod non est Corpus, nec
Virtus in Corpore.’<a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> Maimonides, like Averroës,
was a native of Cordova, and hence no doubt arose
the interest that was felt in his works by the
Toledan translators.</p>

<p>That the Venice manuscript is to be understood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
as a collection of the versions which came from that
school appears plainly in the dedication to Stephen
of Provins. This is generally prefixed to the <cite>De
Coelo et Mundo</cite>, thus forming an introduction to
the versions which follow; but here it has been
placed at the end of the volume, occurring immediately
after the short article <cite>De Vita Aristotelis</cite>
which closes the whole series. We may see in this
fact a certain probability that some at least of these
additional versions may have been the work of
Michael Scot himself. Nor will the five years which
he spent at Toledo appear too scant a space of time
for the production of the whole body of the Latin
Averroës and something more, when we remember
the ample and able assistance he enjoyed in the
prosecution of his labours as a translator.</p>

<p>There is one other version of which we must
speak before leaving the subject which has engaged
our attention so long. The library of St. Omer
contains a manuscript collection of the works of
Aristotle in Latin which was written during the
thirteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> The fly-leaf at the commencement
of this volume shows the same handwriting
as the other pages, and has proved upon examination
to be the last relic of a work which has unfortunately
perished. What that work was may be
seen from the closing words, which are as follows:
‘Here end the <cite>Nova Ethica</cite> of Aristotle, which
Master Michael Scot translated from the Greek
language into the Latin.’ This colophon opens a
curious question. Are we to consider that the
scribe wrote <em>Greek</em> when he should rather have said
<em>Arabic</em>? It was by a mistake of such a kind that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
the writer of the Victorine manuscript asserted
that Averroës had commented on the <cite>De Anima</cite> in
<em>Greek</em>.<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> Taking it in this way the version of the
<cite>Nova Ethica</cite> would fall into line with the others
which Scot and Gerard of Cremona composed at
Toledo. But it deserves notice that none of the
manuscript collections usually considered to contain
the work of that school comprises among its contents
the <cite>Nova Ethica</cite>. We know, further, that a
Latin version of the Ethics with the commentary
of Averroës was made from the Arabic by Hermannus
Alemannus.<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> This work was completed on the
third of June 1240, and we can hardly suppose
that it would have been entered on if Michael Scot
had already accomplished the same task but twenty
years earlier. These facts and considerations make
it very unlikely that the St. Omer fragment represents
a version of the Arabic text.</p>

<p>Assuming then the literal truth of this interesting
colophon, we are confirmed in the conclusion
to which an examination of the <cite>De Partibus Animalium</cite>
in the Florence manuscript has already
inclined our minds.<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> Michael Scot, it must now be
held, did not confine his studies altogether to the
Arabian authors, but undertook to form translations
directly from the Greek. These two versions,
and especially that of the <cite>Nova Ethica</cite>, open up
a new and striking view of the scholar’s literary
activity. When Aquinas moved Pope Urban to
order a new translation of Aristotle from the original,
William of Moerbeka and those others who presently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
entered upon this work were tilling no virgin soil,
but a familiar field in which the plough of Scot at
least had left deep furrows. Even the renowned
Grostête, Bishop of Lincoln, who executed a version
of the <cite>Ethica</cite> from the Greek about 1250, was but
following in the path which this earlier master
had opened up. Michael Scot here takes rank with
Boëthius and Jacobus de Venetiis, who were among
the first to seek these pure and original sources of
Aristotelic doctrine. He appears as one who not
only completed the knowledge of his time with
regard to the Arabian philosophy by translating
Averroës, but who gave some help at least to lay
the foundation of a more exact acquaintance with
the works of Aristotle by opening a direct way to
the Greek text. We may even see a sign of this
remarkable position in the place of honour given,
perhaps accidentally, to Scot’s version of the <cite>Nova
Ethica</cite> at the opening of the St. Omer manuscript.
He stands between two ages, and lays a hand of
power upon each.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to add that in this he
shines all the more brightly when compared with
his great detractor. Roger Bacon, secure in the
consciousness of his commanding abilities, attacks
with a rare self-confidence, not Michael Scot alone,
but all the scholars of his time. Not four of them,
he says, know Hebrew, Greek, and Arabic.<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> Those
who pretend to translate from these tongues are
ignorant even of Latin, not to speak of the sciences
treated of in the books which they pretend to
render intelligible. Busy in penning these diatribes,
Bacon does not seem to have reflected that the best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
way of reproving the imperfections of which he
complained would have been to shame these scholars
to some purpose by producing better versions on
his own account. But the truth of the matter lies
here, that Bacon was no linguist. This appears
plainly from the tale he tells against himself in the
<cite>Compendium Studii</cite>; how a hard word in Aristotle
had baffled him till one day there came some outlandish
students to hear him lecture, who laughed
at his perplexity, telling him it was good Spanish
for the plant called Henbane.<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> ‘Hinc illae lachrymae’
then, and a plague on Michael Scot and all
his tribe, who know Spanish so well they will not
put a plain Latin word for the puzzled professor
to understand. No wonder that to Scot rather than
to Bacon, for all his genius, that age owed the chief
part of the first translation of Aristotle and a good
beginning of the second.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="smaller">SCOT AGAIN AT COURT</span></h2>

<p>The return of Michael Scot from Spain to the Imperial
Court was doubtless a striking moment, not
only in the life of the philosopher himself, but in
the history of letters. He then appeared fresh from a
great enterprise, and bringing with him the proofs of
its success in the form of the Latin Averroës. We
cannot doubt that his reception was worthy of the
occasion and of one who had served his master so
faithfully.</p>

<p>Frederick was now returned to his dominions in
the south. He had established his imperial rights
in Germany at the cost of a campaign in which the
pretensions of Otho were successfully overcome,
and, on his return homeward in 1220, he had
received the crown once more in Rome at the hands
of the supreme ecclesiastical authority. His progress
was indeed a continual scene of triumph.
Arrived at Palermo, the court gave itself up to
feasting and gaiety of every kind.</p>

<p>Two ancient romantic authorities<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> choose with
dramatic instinct this moment, and these gay and
voluptuous surroundings, as the <i lang="fr">mise en scène</i> amid
which they show us Scot again appearing to resume<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
the place he had quitted more than ten years before.
It is quite possible that there may be a measure of
historic truth here, as well as the art which can seize
or create an occasion, and which loves to contrast the
triumph of arms with the more peaceful honours of
literary fame. Frederick, we must remember, in a
sort represented both. He was Maecenas as well as
Caesar. In welcoming Michael Scot and doing him
honour at these imperial banquets he was but crowning
the success of an enterprise in which his own
name and interest were deeply engaged.</p>

<p>Traces of the impression made by this highly
significant incident have been preserved in the arts
of poetry and painting as well as in that of prose
romance. Dante, who wrote his <cite>Divine Comedy</cite> less
than a century later than the time of Scot, has
given the philosopher a place in his poem, describing
him as:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">‘Quell’altro, che ne’ fianchi è così poco,</div>
<div class="verse">Michele Scotto fu.’<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The commentators, with great reason, refer the
epithet ‘poco’ to the manner of Scot’s dress. It
would seem that the Spaniards of those days differed
from the other European nations in their habit.
They wore a close girdle about the waist, like the
<i>hhezum</i> of the East; and indeed they had probably
taken the fashion from long familiarity with their
Moorish masters and neighbours.<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> Scot must have
adopted such a dress while at Toledo, and thus,
when he returned to Palermo, the singularity of his
appearance struck the eyes of the court at once.
The impression proved a remarkably enduring one,
since, even in Dante’s day, it still persisted, offering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
itself, as we have seen, to the poet as a picturesque
means of presenting the famous scholar to the world,
not without a hidden reference to what was certainly
one of the crowning moments of his life.</p>

<p>We may suspect indeed that the fashion of Scot’s
dress was more than simply Spanish; for the mode
of Aragon at least must surely have been too familiar
at Frederick’s court to excite so much attention.
The philosopher had lived long in close company
with the Moors of Toledo and Cordova. What he
wore was probably no mere fragment of Eastern
fashion but the complete costume of an Arabian sage.
The flowing robes, the close-girt waist, the pointed
cap, were not unknown in Sicily where there was
still a considerable Moorish population, yet they
must have sat strangely enough upon Scot when
once he declared himself for what he was: the
reverend ecclesiastic, the Master of Paris, the native
of the far north.</p>

<p>There is a fresco on the south wall<a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> of the Spanish
Chapel in the cloisters of Santa Maria Novella of
Florence which contains a figure answering nearly
to this conjecture regarding Scot’s appearance. It
is that of a man in the prime of life, slight and dark,
with a short brown beard trimmed to a point. He
wears a long close-fitting robe of a reddish colour,
noticeably narrow at the waist, with a falling girdle.
On his head is a tall red pointed cap from which the
ringlets of his dark hair escape on each side. He
stands among the converts of the Dominican preachers
and bends towards the spectator with an intense
expression and action as he tears the leaves out of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
heretical book<a name="FNanchor_198" id="FNanchor_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> that rests on his knee. It would be
too much to assert that the figure we have described
was meant as a portrait of Michael Scot, yet considering
the place he holds in the <cite>Divine Comedy</cite>, it
is not impossible that such an idea may have crossed
the artist’s mind and left these traces in his work.
Certainly no better pictorial illustration can be
found, at once of Dante’s lines, and of the somewhat
equivocal reputation which began to haunt Scot from
the time of his return to court. There was indeed
a singular fitness in the Moslem dress considered as
the daily wear of one who, though a Christian and
a Churchman, had just done more than any living
scholar to introduce the Moorish science and philosophy
in the West. His choice of such a fashion
is evidence that Michael Scot possessed a ready
adaptability to his circumstances, and even a vein of
aesthetic and dramatic instinct which we might not
otherwise have suspected. But it is not to be forgotten
that his versions of Averroës were already
condemned by the Church, and that the very manner
of Scot’s appearance when he brought them from Spain
must have heightened the suspicions of heresy which
began to attach themselves to the translator of these
forbidden works. The only hope for such a man was
that he might be induced to tear his book and turn
to less dangerous pursuits. This is exactly the idea
which the painter of the Spanish Chapel has expressed,
and in a form which accords so remarkably with the
picturesque description of Michael Scot by Dante.<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>If the philosopher did not actually take such
extreme measures with the creatures of his brain
and pen, the versions he brought to Sicily were at
least suppressed in the meantime, being concealed
in the imperial closet till a more suitable opportunity
should occur for their publication. This
done, their author devoted himself to pursuits less
likely to attract unfavourable notice than those in
which he had been lately engaged.</p>

<p>The place and duty which most naturally offered
themselves to Scot were those of the Court
Astrologer. We have seen him occupied in this
way already, before he left Palermo for Spain, and
there seems no reason to doubt the tradition which
says that such was indeed the standing occupation
of his life, and one which he resumed at once on his
return. To this application of celestial science the
opinion of the times attached no sinister interpretation,
and Scot, finding himself the object of suspicion
on account of his late studies and achievements,
must have fallen back with a sense of security,
strange as it may seem, upon the casting of horoscopes
and the forming of presages founded on the
flight of birds and the motion of animals.<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p>

<p>It is therefore in all likelihood to this period
in his life that we are to ascribe several works on
astrology and kindred subjects which bear the
name of Scot. They may have come from his pen
by way of supplement to the doctrine which he
had expounded so many years before in the <cite>Liber<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
Introductorius</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> Such are the <cite>Astrologia</cite> of the
Munich Library,<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> and a curious volume preserved
in the Hof-Bibliothek of Vienna with the following
title: ‘Michaelis Scoti Capitulum de iis quae
generaliter significantur in partibus duodecim Caeli,
sive Domibus.’<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> The <cite>De Presagiis Stellarum et
Elementaribus</cite>, and the <cite>Notitia convinctionis Mundi
terrestris cum Coelesti</cite>, cited by the writer on Scot
in the <cite>Encyclopedia Britannica</cite>, belong apparently
to the same class.</p>

<p>We shall probably commit no error in assuming
that the astrological views of Scot at this period
were substantially the same as those embodied in
his earlier writings on that subject.<a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> In after ages
they were severely censured by Pico della Mirandola,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
who says of Scot’s doctrine concerning the
stellar images: ‘These invisible forms can be discerned
neither by the senses nor by right reason,
and there is no agreement regarding them by their
inventors, who were not the Chaldeans or Indians
but only the Arabs.’ … ‘Michael Scot mentions
all these (images) as things most effectual, and with
him agree many astrologers, both Arabian and Latin.
I had heard somewhat of this doctrine, and thought
at first that it was meant merely as a convenient
means of mapping out the sky, and not that these
figures actually existed in the heavens.…’
‘From the Greeks astrology passed to the Arabs
and was taught with ever-growing assurance.…’
‘Aboasar, a grammarian and historical writer, took
this science from the Greeks, corrupting it with
countless trifling fables, and made thereof an
astrology much worse than that of Ptolemy.…’
‘In those days the study of mathematics, like that
of philosophy in general, made great progress in
Spain under King Alphonso, a keen student in the
calculus, especially as applied to the movements of
the heavenly bodies. He had also a taste for the
vain arts of the Diviner, having learned no better;
and to please him in this many of the most important
treatises of that kind, both Greek and
Arabic, have been handed down to our own day,
chiefly by the labours of Johannes Hispalensis and
Michael Scot, the latter of whom was an author
of no weight and full of superstition. Albertus
Magnus at first was somewhat carried away with
this doctrine, for it came with the power of
novelty to his inexperienced youth, but I rather
think that his opinions suffered change in later<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
life.’<a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> Mirandola belonged to another age than
that of Scot, when purer conceptions of astronomical
science were already beginning to prevail, but the
very opinions he condemned held a real relation to
that progress. They encouraged in early times, as
may be seen in the case of Alphonso himself, a
study of the heavenly motions without which no
true advance could have been made.</p>

<p>A story told by the chronicler Salimbene may,
if rightly understood, show us that Michael Scot
too, for all his astrological dreams, was a clever
calculator and thus stood well in the line on which
true advance in astronomy was even then proceeding.
The Emperor asked him one day to determine
the distance of the <i lang="la">coelum</i>, which probably means
the height of the roof, in a certain hall of the
palace where they happened to be standing together.
The calculation having been made and the result
given, Frederick took occasion to send Scot on a
distant journey, and, while he was away, the proportions
of the room were slightly but sufficiently
altered. On his return the Emperor led him where
they had been before and asked that he should
repeat his solution of the problem. Scot unhesitatingly
affirmed that a change had taken place;
either the floor was higher or the <i lang="la">coelum</i> lower than
before: an answer which made all men marvel at
his skill.<a name="FNanchor_206" id="FNanchor_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> Greek science had taught the art of
measuring inaccessible distances by means of angular
observations, and this art was well understood by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
the Arabs. The <cite>Optica</cite> of Ptolemy were already
translated into Latin from an Arabic version by
Eugenio, admiral to King Robert of Sicily during
the twelfth century,<a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> and mathematical instruments
were known in that kingdom whereby angles could
be taken and measured with some nicety. Scot
must have possessed such an <em>astrolabe</em> and the
skill to use it with great delicacy, if we have
rightly read the terms of the problem he solved so
unhesitatingly. There is no cause for wonder
then in the fact that, where pure and legitimate
astronomy was concerned, this philosopher, who
had won fame in his student days as the mathematician
of Paris, who was now widely known as
the translator of Alpetrongi, and who as a keen
observer and ready calculator was well qualified for
original research, should have taken a high place in
these studies on his own account, and should have
come to be acknowledged as a master in them.
Even Bacon, who blamed Michael Scot so bitterly
when language or philosophy were in question,
speaks in a different way here, calling him a
‘notable inquirer into matter, motion, and the
course of the constellations.’</p>

<p>This well-earned celebrity may have been owing
in no small degree to a mathematical and astronomical
work produced by the philosopher after his
return to court. Sacrobosco, the famous English
astronomer, had just risen into notice by his
treatise on the <cite>Sphere</cite>. This book was not indeed
very remarkable in itself, but it obtained an extraordinary
currency during the Middle Ages, and after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
the invention of printing as well as before it:<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> a
popularity chiefly due, we may believe, to its
suggestiveness, which caused many of the learned
to enrich the <cite>Sphere</cite> of Sacrobosco with their own
notes and observations. One of the first to do so
was Michael Scot. His commentary on the work
of Holywood contains several subtle inquiries and
determinations regarding the source of heat, the
sphericity of the heavenly bodies, and other matters,
which have been repeated by Libri with the remark
that their author must have been far in advance of
his times.<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a></p>

<p>We may notice here a curious legend of Naples
to which Sir Walter Scott has drawn attention in
the account he gives of his great namesake.<a name="FNanchor_210" id="FNanchor_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> It
would seem to suggest that this age, perhaps by
means of Michael Scot, was acquainted with philosophical
instruments rarer if not more useful than
the astrolabe. The romance of <cite>Vergilius</cite> tells how
that hero founded ‘in the middes of the see a fayer
towne, with great landes belongynge to it; … and
called it Napells. And the fandacyon of it was of
egges, and in that towne of Napells he made a tower
with iiii corners, and in the toppe he set an apell
upon an yron yarde, and no man culd pull away
that apell without he brake it; and thoroughe that
yren set he a bolte, and in that bolte set he a egge.
And he henge the apell by the stauke upon a cheyne,
and so hangeth it still. And when the egge styrreth,
so shoulde the towne of Napells quake; and when the
egge brake, then shulde the towne sinke,’ The
reference here is of course to the <em>Castel del Ovo</em> at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
Naples, a fortress which we know to have been
built, or at least strengthened, by Frederick <span class="smcapuc">II.</span>
What if the rest of the legend embalm, like a fly
in amber, the tradition, strangely altered, of some
instrument set up there to measure the force of
the earthquakes so prevalent in that part of Italy?</p>

<p>Such a notion is not the pure matter of conjecture
it may at first sight seem to be. Frederick was
in relation with those who might well have put him
in possession of this among other secrets. When
the Tartars stormed the <em>Vulture’s Nest</em>, as it was
called, in the Syrian castle of Alamout, they found
an observatory well supplied with instruments of
precision, and that of all kinds.<a name="FNanchor_211" id="FNanchor_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> Now this place
was the last refuge of the Assassins, that strange
sect who owned obedience to the Old Man of the
Mountain. Frederick <span class="smcapuc">II.</span> when in the East paid
these people a visit,<a name="FNanchor_212" id="FNanchor_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> and again at Melfi, in his own
dominions, he received their ambassadors and entertained
them at a great banquet.<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> Considering then
the Emperor’s well-known curiosity in all matters
of physical science, we may feel sure he would
profit by any improvements or discoveries the observers
at Alamout could communicate. If the
contrivance set up at Naples was really a <em>seismometer</em>,
this would furnish a curious comment on
Bacon’s statement that Michael Scot excelled in
investigating the movements of matter.<a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

<p>Passing to what rests on more certain evidence,
we find Scot’s fame in those days attested by one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
of his most distinguished contemporaries, and that
in a way which makes him appear as an honoured
master in the science of algebra, then lately introduced
from the Moorish schools. This improvement
and testimony were both of them due to a certain
Leonardo of the Bonacci family of Pisa, who was,
perhaps, the first to bring the new method of calculation
to the knowledge of his countrymen. His
father had been overseer of the customs at Bougie,
in Barbary,<a name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> on behalf of the Pisan merchants who
traded thither. Observing the superior way of
reckoning used by the Moors in that country, he
sent home for his son that the boy might be trained
in this admirable way of counting. Leonardo perfected
his art in after years by travel and study in
Egypt, Syria, and Greece, as well as in Sicily and
Provence. The ripe fruit of this knowledge saw
the light in 1222, when he published for the
first time his famous <cite>Liber Abbaci</cite>. It consisted of
fifteen chapters, in which the author declared the
secret of the Indian numerals as well as the fundamental
processes of algebra.<a name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></p>

<p>This brief account of one who must ever hold an
honourable place in the history of mathematical
science may enable us to value at its true worth
the praise which Leonardo bestowed on Michael
Scot. It seems that the first edition of the <cite>Liber
Abbaci</cite> was not entirely satisfactory. Scot wrote
a letter to the author which possibly contained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
strictures on the work, and asked that a copy of
the emended edition should be sent him. Pisano
replied by dedicating the book to his correspondent.
It appeared in 1228, and contained a prefatory
letter, in which the author addresses Scot in the
highest terms of respect, calling him by that title
of <em>Supreme Master</em> which he had won at Paris,
and submitting the <cite>Liber Abbaci</cite>, even in this its
final form, to his further emendation. This <i lang="la">laudari
a laudato</i> must have been most grateful to
the philosopher, and it enables us to see the standing
he had among the mathematicians of his time.
One would almost be disposed to infer, from the
respect Pisano paid him, that Scot himself had
composed or translated some lost work on algebra.
In another connection we shall find reason to think
that this conjecture may be well founded.<a name="FNanchor_217" id="FNanchor_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

<p>Besides the practice of astrology and his deeper
researches in astronomy and mathematics, Michael
Scot devoted himself to another profession, that of
medicine. This was then a science very imperfectly
understood, yet here too, in the years that followed
his return to court, Scot made a name for himself
as a physician, and contributed something to the
advancement of human knowledge in one of its most
important branches. The healing art in Europe had
only just begun to emerge from that primitive state
in which savage peoples still possess it; overlaid by
charms and incantations; the peculiar department
of the wise woman, the sorcerer, and the priest.
Among the Latin races the lady of the castle and
the <i lang="it">bella donna</i> of the village still cared for rich
and poor in their various accidents and sicknesses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
as indeed they continued to do for several ages
more. Only crowned heads, the wealthiest of the
nobility, or the rich merchants of the cities, began
to require and employ the services of regular
physicians. These were generally Jews, sometimes
Moors;<a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> and thus fashion and experience alike began
to make popular among our ancestors the superior
claims of science in medicine. Such science had undoubtedly
survived from the days and in the works
of Hippocrates, Galen, and Celsus, and was now
preserved in the theory and practice of the Arabian
schools.</p>

<p>This point once reached, a further advance soon
became inevitable. Attention had been called to
a deeper source of medical knowledge than that
generally possessed in the West. Learned men,
whose tastes led them this way, naturally sought
to inform their minds by procuring translations of
the Arabic works on medicine. The just fame of
Salerno, a medical school which had been founded
in the closing years of the eleventh century by
Robert Guiscard, depended on the intelligent zeal
with which this plan of research was then pursued.<a name="FNanchor_219" id="FNanchor_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a>
The kingdom of Sicily indeed occupies as important
a place in the progress of the healing art as Spain
itself does with regard to the history of philosophy
and of science in general.</p>

<p>Frederick <span class="smcapuc">II.</span>, as might have been expected, did
much to encourage and regulate these useful studies.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
We have already noticed the bent of his mind towards
comparative physiology, and the daring experiments
he carried out, <i lang="la">in corpore vili et vivo</i>.
One of the first literary and scientific works which
he commanded, or at least accepted when it was
dedicated to him, was a compilation from three
ancient authors upon a medical subject.<a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> He was
then but eighteen years of age. As time went on
his interest in this science continued, and became
the motive to a liberal and enlightened policy. He
regarded medicine as a matter of national importance,
and strove by wise laws to make the practice
of that profession as intelligent and useful as possible.
He protected the faculty at Salerno and
created that of Naples. None might lecture elsewhere
in the Sicilies, and every physician in the
kingdom must hold testimonials from one or other
of these schools, as well as a government licence
to practise. The course preliminary to qualification
consisted of three years in arts and five in
medicine and surgery. As a guide to the professors,
the doctrine of Hippocrates and Galen was declared
normal in the schools; yet, lest this should become
merely formal and traditional, directions were given
that the students should have practice in anatomy.
Regarding the related trade of the apothecary, the
laws denounced the adulteration of drugs. Physicians
might not claim a greater fee than half a <i lang="it">taren</i> of
gold per diem, which gave the patient a right to
be visited thrice in the day. The poor were to be
attended free of charge. We have thought it right
to be particular in these details, as they throw
light on the times, and on Scot’s own practice as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
a physician. Considering indeed the place he held
about the Emperor’s person, and the high estimation
in which his master held him, it seems not at all
improbable that his may have been the hand which
drew these wise enactments, or his at least the
suggestion which commended them to Frederick.
They must in any case have been the rules under
which he carried on his work as a doctor of medicine.</p>

<p>This branch of Michael Scot’s activity relates
itself easily and naturally to what we already know
of his acquirements and familiarity with the Arabian
authors. It was from the <cite>De Medicina</cite> of Rases
that he borrowed so much material for his <cite>Physionomia</cite>.
The <cite>Abbreviatio Avicennae</cite> too, which he
translated for Frederick in 1210, was in no small
part a treatise on comparative anatomy and physiology,
nor is it likely that he can have missed reading
the famous <em>canon</em> of the same author, in which
Avicenna expounds a complete body of practical
medicine. We need not wonder then to find that,
on Scot’s return to court, his work on Averroës
done, he added the practice of physic to his duties
as Imperial Astrologer. This new profession must
have offered itself to him as another means of
securing a general forgetfulness of the questionable
direction in which his philosophical studies
had lately carried him.</p>

<p>He seems in fact to have won almost as much
fame in medicine as he had made for himself in the
study of mathematics. Lesley says ‘he gained much
praise as a philosopher, astronomer, and physician.’
Dempster speaks of his ‘singular skill,’ calling
him ‘one of the first physicians for learning’<a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
and adding that Camperius<a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> had the highest
opinion of him. An anonymous writer, <cite>De claris
Doctrina Scotis</cite>, is even more precise, telling us
that Scot was noted for the cures he effected in
difficult cases, and that he excelled in the treatment
of leprosy, gout, and dropsy.<a name="FNanchor_223" id="FNanchor_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a></p>

<p>Some slight remains of this skill are to be found
in the libraries of Europe; for Michael Scot was
a writer on the science of his art as well as a
practising physician. The chief of these relics is
a considerable work on the urine. This subject
had been widely, if not deeply, studied by the more
ancient medical authorities, whose investigations
appear in the <cite>Ketab Albaul</cite> of Al Kairouani,<a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> and in
a book to which we have already more than once
referred: the <cite>De Urinis</cite> compiled for Frederick in
1212.<a name="FNanchor_225" id="FNanchor_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> The same title belongs to one of the treatises
by Avicenna, which has been reprinted in the present
century.<a name="FNanchor_226" id="FNanchor_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a></p>

<p>The <cite>De Urinis</cite> of Michael Scot seems now
extant in the form of an Italian translation alone.
The exact title is as follows: ‘Della notitia e prognosticatione
dell’orine, secondo Michele Scoto, così
de’ sani, come delli infermi,’ or, more briefly, ‘El
trattato de le urine secondo Michaele Scoto.’<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
author enumerates no less than nineteen divisions
of his subject, which he seems to have studied very
exactly. This work long remained an authority in
the medical schools, as appears, not only from the two
translations we have noticed, but also in the fact that
large use was made of it in a later collection which
commences thus: ‘In the name of the Lord, Amen.
These are certain recipes taken from the book of
Master Michael Scot, Physician to the Emperor
Frederick, and from the works of other Doctors.’<a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></p>

<p>There has also come down to us a prescription called
<cite>Pillulae Magistri Michaelis Scoti</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> It enumerates
about a dozen ingredients and the scribe has added<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
an extravagant commendation of its healing powers.
Mineral medicines were evidently not in fashion in
those days; for the recipe speaks only of simples
derived from herbs of different kinds. It is to be
observed that this agrees exactly with the practice
of Salerno, as the Materia Medica of that school
was chiefly drawn from the botany of Dioscorides
afterwards expounded by Ibn Beithar of Malaga,
the great Moorish authority on the healing virtues
of plants. There is no reason then to doubt the
truth of the title which ascribes the prescription
for these pills to Michael Scot. It is in any case
a curious relic of early medical practice.</p>

<p>It is possible that the great plague which fell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
upon Palermo at the time of Frederick’s marriage
may have been, in part at least, the occasion of
that interest which both the Emperor and his
astrologer took in the healing art. These epidemics,
which in several of their most fatal forms are now
only known by tradition, were the dreaded scourge
of the Middle Ages; their prevalence being no doubt
due to the rude and insanitary habits of life which
were then universal. We read of another infectious
sickness which attacked Frederick and his crusaders
when they were on the point of sailing from Brindisi
in 1227. The season was one of terrible heat, so
great indeed that one chronicle says the rays of the
sun melted solid metal! Lying in the confinement
of their galleys on an unhealthy coast the troops
suffered severely. At last rain fell, but immediately
poisonous damps arose from the steaming soil,
and the plague began to show itself. Two bishops
and the Landgrave of Thuringia were among the
victims of the pestilence, and very many of the
crusaders died. Frederick himself ran considerable
risk of his life. Against the advice of his physician
he had exposed himself to the sun in the course of
his journey to Brindisi. After three days with the
fleet he was obliged to return on account of the
state of his health, when he at once went to the
waters at Pozzuoli, which proved a successful cure.
Michael Scot must have entered into these affairs
with a large concern and responsibility for his
master’s health, and we shall think much of the
importance and consequence he enjoyed at this time
when we remember that the chief object of his care
as a physician was the life of one on whom interests
that were more than European then depended.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="smaller">THE LAST DAYS OF MICHAEL SCOT</span></h2>

<p>The various occupations in which Michael Scot
engaged upon his return to court were not without
their due and, as we believe, designed effect. The
part he had taken in producing the Latin Averroës
was soon forgotten when it appeared that no
immediate publication of these proscribed works
was intended by the Emperor. Scot now stood
boldly before the world in no suspicious character;
distinguished only by his great learning and the
fidelity with which he discharged his offices of
astrologer and physician about the Imperial person.</p>

<p>This rehabilitation of his fame opened the way
to further honours and emoluments which Frederick
soon began to seek on his servant’s behalf. Scot
had never quite lost character as a churchman, and
the member of a great religious Order, though his
studies had carried him far from the somewhat
narrow and beaten track of an ordinary ecclesiastical
education. Like Philip of Tripoli, he was probably
in holy orders, and even held a benefice, while,
as we see from the dedication of his <cite>De Coelo et
Mundo</cite> to Stephen of Provins, he was careful, even
in the wildest heats of his work on Averroës, to keep
in touch with those who held high positions in the
Church. Soon after his return from Spain a resolute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
and repeated attempt was made to secure for him
some ecclesiastical preferment.</p>

<p>Honorius <span class="smcapuc">III.</span> then sat in the Chair of St. Peter.
In 1223 a dispensation was granted by the Curia
allowing Michael Scot to hold a plurality. At
the same time the Pope wrote to Stephen Langton
the Primate of England, desiring that Scot should
be preferred to the first suitable place which might
fall vacant in that country.<a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> Honorius was then
at peace with the Emperor, and we may believe
that it was in consequence of some strong representation
made by Frederick that he took such an
interest in the fortunes of this Imperial <i lang="fr">protégé</i>.</p>

<p>The application to Canterbury was entirely in
accordance with the habits of the time; for England
was then the constant resource of the Popes when
they wished to confer a favour on any of their
clergy. Many and deep were the complaints which
this practice awakened among the priesthood of
the north. A like abuse of influence appeared in
Scotland as well. Theiner reports the case of a
clerk named Peter, the son of Count George of
Cabaliaca, on whose behalf the Pope wrote in
1259 to the Canons of St. Andrews, desiring that
he might be reinstated in his benefice of Chinachim
(Kennoway in Fife) which he had forfeited
as an adherent of the Empire.<a name="FNanchor_231" id="FNanchor_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> It is only fair,
however, to notice that there were instances of
the contrary practice. In 1218, for example, one
Matthew, a Scot, was recommended by Honorius
to the University of Paris for the degree of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
Doctor, that he might teach there in the faculty of
Divinity.</p>

<p>It may seem remarkable that the Pope did
not address his application in Scot’s favour to
St. Andrews rather than to Canterbury. We are
to recollect, however, that in 1223, the relations
between Scotland and the See of Rome were
still somewhat strained. The North had not
yet forgotten what took place in 1217, when
Gualo came thither as Legate to lay the Interdict
upon Scotland. Churches were closed by this
severe sentence; the sacraments forbidden; even
that of extreme unction denied to the people;
the dead were buried without service, and all
marriages were celebrated in the churchyards.
When the interdict was removed in the following
year, the duty of proclaiming that remission was
intrusted to the Prior of Durham and the Dean
of York, who made a solemn progress in the
Kingdom to announce the Pope’s clemency. We
may feel sure that these events were not forgotten
in five years by a proud and independent
nation like the people of Scotland, and Honorius
must be thought to have judged rightly in supposing
his application on Scot’s account had a
better chance of being effected by the English
than by the Scottish Primate. Nothing indeed
was overlooked that might give force to the
recommendation. The Pope accompanied his request
with a generous testimony to the scholar’s
ability, saying that he was distinguished, even
among learned men, for his remarkable gifts and
knowledge.<a name="FNanchor_232" id="FNanchor_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> Thus everything seemed to promise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
that Michael Scot would soon enjoy a rich English
living; the <i lang="es">El dorado</i> of the foreign clergy in
those easy days of sinecures secured by dispensations
of plurality and non-residence.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, however, a much more favourable
occasion offered itself to the Pope for securing
the interests of Frederick’s <i lang="fr">protégé</i>, and one which
dispensed with any concurrence of the English
Primate in the matter. In the same year which
witnessed his application to Stephen Langton a
vacancy occurred in the Archbishopric of Cashel.
The chapter of that see proposed a candidate of
their own to Honorius, probably the Bishop of
Cork, but the Pope saw his opportunity and named
Michael Scot for the vacant benefice. The obedient
Chapter at once proceeded to elect him. The
consequence being to their apprehension a foregone
conclusion, the Curia issued another dispensation
permitting this favourite of fortune to hold the
Archbishopric along with all his other benefices.<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>
So nearly did Scot come to the possession of a
high place in the Church, and an office which would
surely have altered his fame in the ages that were
to come.</p>

<p>But those who thus took into their hands the
shaping of the future for Michael Scot were soon
to learn that the man they had to deal with was
of another nature than their own; a very Scot
in his scruples and the conscientiousness with which
he gave effect to them. Incredible as it must
then have seemed, remarkable as it would be even
in our own day, Michael Scot refused Cashel,<a name="FNanchor_234" id="FNanchor_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
this for a reason which showed how high was the
conception he had formed of the pastoral office.
His <i lang="la">nolo episcopari</i> proceeded on the ground that
he was ignorant of the Irish language. He would
not, it seems, be a chief pastor without the power
to teach and feed the flock committed to his
care. He would not consent to be intruded upon a
people to whom he must have proved unacceptable,
nor would he, in the too common fashion of the
day, commit his duties in Ireland to a suffragan,
while enjoying ample revenues and a lordly title
in Italy.</p>

<p>It is somewhat startling to find a principle
not unheard of in the Scotland of our own century
so clearly grasped and so conscientiously followed
by this <em>non-intrusionist</em> countryman of ours six
hundred years ago. Yet Michael Scot did not
stand alone in his sacrifice even in these slack
times, as may be seen by the case of his namesake,
John Scot, who was Bishop of Dunkeld during
the pontificate of Clement <span class="smcapuc">III.</span><a name="FNanchor_235" id="FNanchor_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> This earlier Prelate
ruled a vast diocese which included the country
of Argyll as well as the more eastern parts of
central Scotland. His conscience became uneasy
under the responsibility, and, unwilling to continue
the spiritual overseer of those whom from his
ignorance of their language he could not edify,
he wrote to the Pope, desiring that Argyll might
be disjoined from Dunkeld, and that Ewaldus his
chaplain, who knew Erse, might have charge of
the new diocese as its Bishop. This was actually
done in 1200, and the good Bishop died in great
peace two years later. ‘How can I give a comfortable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
account to the Judge of the world at
the last day,’ so he had written to Clement, ‘if
I pretend to teach those who cannot understand
me? The revenues suffice for two Bishops, if
we are content with a competency, and are
not prodigal of the patrimony of Christ. It is
better to lessen the charge and increase the
number of labourers in the Lord’s Vineyard.’ In
some such terms must Michael Scot too have
declined Cashel. His case, as well as that of
Dunkeld, is enough to show that ecclesiastical
corruption, though widespread, was not, even in
those days, universal. May no Cervantes of the
Church ever arise in Scotland to laugh such
sacred chivalry away!</p>

<p>The disappointment he nevertheless felt on this
occasion may probably have encouraged Scot in
his attachment to the court and to his new duties
there as astrologer and physician, in which, as we
have seen, he rose to such acknowledged eminence.
Frederick did not, however, lose sight of his purpose
to procure him preferment. The first application
to Canterbury having met with no response
it was renewed four years later in 1227, by
Gregory <span class="smcapuc">IX.</span>, who in that year succeeded Honorius
in the Chair of St. Peter. This new Pontiff was
destined to become the Emperor’s most bitter and
relentless foe, but as yet he remained on good
terms with Frederick and inclined to show him
favour. He seems to have made no difficulty in
taking up the case of Michael Scot, and even
added on his own account a eulogy meant to
forward the scholar’s claim; representing him as
a distinguished student, not only in Latin letters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
but also of the Hebrew and Arabic languages.<a name="FNanchor_236" id="FNanchor_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a>
So far as can be seen, however, the attempt of
1227 shared the fate of that which had been
made in 1223. Canterbury gave no signs of acquiescence,
and Michael Scot, for all his distinction,
remained without the preferment which his friends
so constantly sought to obtain for him.</p>

<p>There is reason to think that from this time a
change took place in the spirit of the philosopher.
The natural chagrin he must have felt as it became
plain that no position he could accept would be
offered to him in the Church affected deeply his
fine and sensitive nature. He soon passed into
a brooding and despondent mood, which remained
unaffected by all the praise and fame paid by the
learned world as a tribute to his remarkable talents
and achievements. It is in this change of temper
to a morbid depression that we are to find the
occasion and inspiring spirit of those strange prophetical
verses which bear his name and which
differ so widely from all the other productions of
his pen.</p>

<p>Such compositions were indeed far from being
uncommon in Italy. The reputed prophecies of
the Erythræan Sibyl were extant in the form of
an epistle supposed to be addressed to the Greeks
under the walls of Troy. This curious composition
is said to have been rendered into the Greek
language from the Syriac by a certain Doxopatros.
His version was one of those volumes which had
reached Sicily from the library of Manuel Comnenus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
Emperor of Constantinople, and was then
translated into Latin during the twelfth century
by Eugenio, admiral to King Roger. A series of
poets from Giovacchino di Fiora<a name="FNanchor_237" id="FNanchor_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> to Jacopone da
Todi<a name="FNanchor_238" id="FNanchor_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> then chose the prophetic lyre and made
it resound with dark sayings and predictions of
misfortune and ruin. Especially worthy of study
in this connection are the verses ascribed to <em>Merlin</em>,
which declare the fate of many Italian cities.<a name="FNanchor_239" id="FNanchor_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> That
Michael Scot gave his talents to this kind of composition
rests on evidence as convincing as any
which establishes the other events of his life.
Pipini the chronicler says that ‘he was reputed
to have the gift of prophecy, for he published
verses in which he foretold the ruin of certain
Italian cities as well as other circumstances.’<a name="FNanchor_240" id="FNanchor_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> An
earlier, indeed a contemporary, authority, Henry
Abrincensis, in a poem presented to Frederick <span class="smcapuc">II.</span>
in 1235 or the early months of the following year,
speaks of Michael Scot as ‘another Apollo,’ ‘a
prophet of truth’ possessed of ‘hidden secrets’ and
the author of ‘certain predictions regarding thee,
O Caesar.’<a name="FNanchor_241" id="FNanchor_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a></p>

<p>Quotations from the prophecies of Scot were
made by Villani.<a name="FNanchor_242" id="FNanchor_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> The lines referring to Florence
may still be read in a manuscript of the Riccardian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
Library in that city,<a name="FNanchor_243" id="FNanchor_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> and in another, preserved in
Padua,<a name="FNanchor_244" id="FNanchor_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> we find the following title: ‘Here begin
certain prophecies of Michael Scot, the most illustrious
astrologer of Lord Frederick the Emperor,
which declare somewhat of the future, to wit, of
certain Italian cities.’ This shows that verses,
bearing to have been composed by Scot, were
current at an early date, though the scribe of
the Paduan manuscript has forgotten to fulfil the
promise he makes in his title, for that which
follows it is not the poetry of Scot but only a dull
treatise on Latin prosody.</p>

<p>It is to Salimbene that we owe the preservation
of these verses in their most complete form. He
must have taken much interest in them, as he is
careful to give, not only the original Latin, but
an Italian translation as well. From his pages
then we shall borrow the text of these curious lines.<a name="FNanchor_245" id="FNanchor_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a>
According to Salimbene they are these:</p>

</div>

<p>It would be difficult to determine how much of
the original composition of Scot these verses preserve,
and how much they owe to later hands. We
cannot be mistaken, however, in remarking their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
uniform tone of melancholy and apprehension, with
the burden of its constantly recurring ‘corruet,’ or
in taking this as a true index to the state of the
author’s mind.</p>

<p>Pipini records two other prophecies of Michael
Scot which serve to confirm this observation in a
high degree.<a name="FNanchor_246" id="FNanchor_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> The astrologer, he says, forecast the
manner of the Emperor’s death, which was to take
place <i lang="la">ad portas ferreas</i>, at certain gates of iron, in
a town named after Flora. This prediction was
generally understood of Florence; the rather perhaps
that the church of Santo Stefano there was called <i lang="la">ad
portam ferream</i>; and Frederick accordingly avoided
coming to that city.<a name="FNanchor_247" id="FNanchor_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> During his last campaign in
1250, however, he fell sick at the town of Fiorentino
or Firenzola in Apulia, and lay in a chamber of the
castle. His bed stood against a wall recently built
to fill up the ancient gateway of the tower, while
within the wall there still remained the iron staples
on which the gate had been hung. Uneasy at the
progress of his disease, and hearing something of
these particulars, the Emperor fell into deep thought
and then exclaimed, ‘This is the place where I shall
make an end, as it was told me. The will of God be
done; for here I shall die,’ and soon afterwards he
breathed his last.</p>

<p>The other prediction which the chronicler attributes
to Scot relates to the occasion of his own death.
This, he said, would take place by the blow of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
stone falling on his head. His calculations were
so exact as even to furnish him with the precise
weight of this instrument of fate. Being in church
one day, with head uncovered at the sacring of the
Mass, a stone, agreeing in all particulars with his
prediction, was shaken from the tower by the
motion of the bellrope and wounded Scot to death.</p>

<p>There is much in these tales which lies apart
from the course of a sober biography; belonging
rather to that legendary and mystic fame of the
philosopher which we shall immediately proceed to
consider. Something, however, in which all these
prophecies agree deserves our attention here, and
that is their sombre and menacing character. ‘Ruinam
predixit,’ says Pipini, referring to Scot’s verses
on the Italian cities, and his thoughts, whether
engaged with Frederick’s fate or his own, seem at
this time to have followed the same dark and
ominous course. Death and destruction now filled
all his mind, much as if he had been a Highlander
gifted with the fatal power of the <i lang="ga">Taisch</i>: a seer to
whom all things looked darkly, and all men wore a
shroud, longer or shorter, to mark the time and the
manner of their end.</p>

<p>With Michael Scot’s account of his own fate
Pipini joins another curious matter, that of the <i lang="la">cervilerium</i>.<a name="FNanchor_248" id="FNanchor_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a>
This was a plate or cap of steel meant to
be worn under the ordinary covering of the head as
an additional defence, and the chronicle says that
Scot invented and wore it that he might be safe
from the danger he foresaw. Taking this together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
with the prophecies, both general and personal, we
can find no better explanation than that which bids
us see in the whole what indicates a case of ecstatic
melancholy such as would seem to be the sad heritage
of not a few finer natures sprung of the stock from
which Michael Scot descended. We hear the same
sad note in the strange jingle he wove so long before
in the preface of his <cite>Physionomia</cite>: ‘Nos ibimus
ibitis, ibunt. Omnia pereunt, praeter amare Deum,’
and one would fain hope that in his frequent fits of
depression Scot may have indeed found rest in what
he thus declares to be the only abiding portion of
the soul. The wild account of his illness at Cordova,
and of the dreams which then visited him is not to
be neglected in this connection. Perhaps the cloud
then first fell which in after-years returned upon
him with such redoubled gloom. Thus the traits of
Scot’s youth fit well the picture we are now constrained
to form, and the whole gives promise that
here at last we may have touched upon the man
himself as he was, physically, mentally, and spiritually.
A slight worn body spent with arduous
study, like a sheath which the sword has almost
broken through; a soul possessed with the sense of
Divine things, yet sad, and subject to strange illusions;
a conscience morbidly awake and painfully
scrupulous; a mind to which almost every branch
of knowledge was familiar, and not incapable of
striking out here and there in a path of its own: if
these be not Michael Scot, scholar in the court and
courtier in the schools, then it may safely be said
that no indications exist which can ever reveal to
us this striking personality as he lived and moved
in the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>We seem to see in him a Pascal of the thirteenth
century; and this all the more that Michael Scot
resembled that great genius not only in the mystical
and superstitious side of his nature but in his devotion
to mathematical science. How piquant is the
contrast between this mighty and gifted child of the
mist and the northern hills and those sunny southern
lands of grape and fig, of white cliff, marble column
and laughing summer sea, where most of his life was
spent. No wonder that those among whom Michael
Scot lived found him somewhat of a mystery at all
times, and, especially in these later days of his
burdened spirit, took him for a Mage, weaving his
dark sayings into regular prophecies. The Latin
races have never been famous for their power to comprehend
the northern character. How much less
was it likely they should in the case of one who
seems to have presented every feature of that racial
type in its extremest form? In our own day this
incapacity takes the way of accusing as madness all
that it cannot fathom of Celtic or Teutonic ways.
In the times of Scot the same impatience found a
more modest expression. He was incomprehensible,
therefore he must be inspired; gifted with the prophet’s
divine and incommunicable fire.</p>

<p>We may take it for granted that much of Michael
Scot’s dissatisfaction and depression upon his disappointment
in seeking ecclesiastical preferment
arose from the feeling that he had made a great
sacrifice in vain. The best years of his life, and the
most strenuous labours of his mind, had been given
to his version of Averroës not without the hope that
he was here laying the foundation of a great literary
and philosophic fame. Moved by a prudence, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
was not altogether selfish since it concerned the
Emperor’s reputation and policy quite as much as
his own, he had submitted to necessity, and saw his
translation suppressed for the sake of avoiding
offence. The sacrifice was great and doubtless
keenly felt, and when in spite of this policy he found
himself still without the position he had confidently
hoped for, with what bitterness must the reawakening
of his literary ambition have been attended.
Near ten years had been lost since his return from
Spain, and still Scot’s Averroës slept, unknown to
the schools, in the honourable but unprofitable
seclusion of the Imperial closet. With the death of
these hopes of preferment, however, all reason for this
unfortunate reserve came to an end so far as Scot
was concerned. As soon as he had once made up
his mind to think no more of a great ecclesiastical
career he was free to urge his master with all
insistence to carry out their long-cherished plan,
and secure undying fame for both by publishing
the new Aristotle in the Universities of
Europe.</p>

<p>Nor was there anything in the policy of the time
which made Frederick unwilling to further a project
which he had all along designed. From the moment
of his elevation to the See of Rome Gregory <span class="smcapuc">IX.</span> had
displayed a firm and unbending temper towards the
Emperor. Frederick felt the first instances of his
harshness in 1227, when, returning sick and feeble
from the baths of Pozzuoli, he found himself excommunicated
because he had not sailed to Palestine
with the Crusade. This severe sentence was
renewed in 1228. Frederick reached the Holy
Land that year, but only to meet a mutinous spirit,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
encouraged among the Crusaders there by the Pope’s
orders. On his return in 1229 the sharp edge of
discipline was again drawn against him, and we
need not wonder if such repeated severity at last
convinced the Emperor that there was no hope of
living at peace with Rome, nor any reason to study
further accommodations with one who seemed determined
to be his enemy. The moment had now come
when restraints, long submitted to for the sake of
policy, being removed, Frederick might well bethink
him of his former plans so long held in reserve, and
take measures to carry out his purpose of enriching
the learned world with the prohibited books
of Averroës.</p>

<p>This plan not only promised to fulfil a long
cherished desire and mortify an implacable foe, it
must also have presented itself in the light of a
welcome concession made to a deserving servant of
the Crown. Michael Scot had laboured long to
form the works in question. His interest, as well
as every other reason, now demanded that they
should lie no longer concealed. The fame he was
certain to gain by this publication would be the
best consolation, perhaps the only one now possible,
for his disappointments in the ecclesiastical career.
To employ him actively in the matter may well have
appeared not only just, considering his previous
interest in it, but the best cure for a spirit sadly
disordered and depressed. We need not wonder
that Frederick at last fully formed his resolution,
or that he chose Michael Scot as the means of
carrying out a publication that was now definitely
determined on.</p>

<p>An imperial circular announced to the learned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
the nature and origin of these new versions.<a name="FNanchor_249" id="FNanchor_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> This
letter was designed to secure for them such general
interest and attention as was due to works of the
first importance. Opening with the avowal of his
devotion to the cause of letters, a confession which
he supported by quoting from the <cite>Metaphysica</cite>,
Frederick touched upon the manifold cares of state
which the conduct of his affairs in the Empire involved.
He added that he had never allowed these to
occupy his whole attention, but had still devoted part
of his time to the pursuits of learning. His mind,
he said, had been particularly attracted to the works
of Aristotle with the commentaries of the Arabian
philosophers, especially those concerning mathematics,
and the books called <cite>Sermoniales</cite>. Finding
that they were inaccessible to Latin scholars, owing
to their obscurity and the foreign tongues in which
they were written, he had commissioned learned
men to translate these works, desiring them to
preserve in their versions the exact style as well as
sense of the original. The treasures thus procured
he would not keep in obscurity, but designed to
publish them for the general good. He addressed
himself to the most famous schools of Christendom
as the proper means of obtaining the diffusion of
this wisdom among those who were able to profit
by it.</p>

<p>Which then were the universities intended by
the Emperor? That of Naples certainly in the first
place, for it was his own creation.<a name="FNanchor_250" id="FNanchor_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> Bologna, also,
we may believe, judging by the estimation in which
we know him to have held that still more ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
seat of learning.<a name="FNanchor_251" id="FNanchor_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> Copies of Frederick’s letter are
indeed extant, which actually bear the address, ‘To
the Masters and Scholars of Bologna.’ Nor can
we think that he forgot Paris, the great centre of
European culture. At least one text has preserved
this the most natural of all directions:—‘To the
Doctors of the Quadrivium at Paris.’<a name="FNanchor_252" id="FNanchor_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> Thus far
then the course of Scot’s journey on this important
business is plain. In it he but reversed the progress
he had made in early years, revisiting in the
contrary order the scenes of his former studies. His
own remarkable fame, the widespread curiosity concerning
the books he brought, and his official character
as Frederick’s Ambassador of Letters, must
have secured him everywhere a cordial and distinguished
reception.</p>

<p>There is reason to think that his travels did
not end when he had reached Paris. Tradition says
he crossed the Channel and visited both England
and Scotland, where his medical skill was highly
appreciated. It is indeed to an English author that
we owe the knowledge of this journey performed
by Michael Scot. The words of Roger Bacon are
of capital importance here, not only telling us of
Scot’s travels, but showing the nature of the work
he carried with him in that progress, and the enthusiasm
with which these books were received.
‘In the days of Michael Scot,’ he says, ‘who, about
the year 1230, made his appearance with certain
books of Aristotle and commentaries of learned men
concerning physics and mathematics, the Aristotelian
philosophy became celebrated in the Latin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
Schools.’<a name="FNanchor_253" id="FNanchor_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> At the time of which he speaks, Bacon,
born in 1214, may probably have been at Oxford
pursuing his studies. It is not necessary to dwell
upon the support which this brings to the tradition
of Scot’s visit to England. We may take it as almost
certain that Oxford was one of the universities
where he appeared and was made welcome.</p>

<p>The tradition that he thereafter pursued his
journey to Scotland rests rather upon arguments
derived from the probability of the case than from
direct evidence. Scot had been a lifetime absent
from his native land, and, finding himself so near it,
a strong impulse must have urged him to revisit
the scenes of his boyhood. Nor is it easy to account
for the fact that his fame, though he spent
so much of his time abroad, attained, and yet retains,
such a currency in the North, except upon
the supposition that he did actually yield to this
attraction and thus once more made himself a familiar
figure in the land of his birth.</p>

<p>One matter of great interest is at least certain.
Scot’s death occurred just at this time, when he
was in the very height of his fame and influence,
and probably while he was still in the North. The
account, so often repeated and reprinted, which
makes him live almost to the close of the century
need not occupy our attention more than a moment.
Already incredible from the time when Jourdain
discovered that Scot’s version of Alpetrongi had
been produced in 1217, such a notion becomes more
than ever impossible since we have been able to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
carry the time of his mature literary activity back
to the year 1210. Vincent of Beauvais, writing
about 1245, talks of ‘old Michael Scot’ in such a
way as to suggest that he had by that time been
long in his grave. But the convincing evidence,
though hitherto little noticed, is to be found in the
poem of Henry d’Avranches, from which we have
already quoted some lines in another connection.
This author remarks regarding Michael Scot:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">‘Thus he who questioned fate, to fate himself submitted,’</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">which shows that the time of his death must have
been earlier than 1235, the date when Abrincensis
composed his poem.<a name="FNanchor_254" id="FNanchor_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></p>

<p>The question is thus reduced to the narrow
limit of five years; since Bacon says Scot was alive
and busy in his great mission in 1230. Within
this period he must have passed away, and probably
his death happened nearer the earlier than the
later date; considering the tone in which Henry
d’Avranches speaks of the departed sage. He may
well therefore have died while on the borders of
Scotland. This idea agrees curiously with the fact
that Italy has no tradition of his burial-place, while
on the other hand northern story points to his
tomb in Melrose Abbey, Glenluce, Holme Coltrame,
or some other of the great Cistercian foundations of
that country. Satchells, who visited Burgh-under-Bowness
in 1629, found a guide named Lancelot
Scot, who took him to the parish church, where he
saw the great scholar’s tomb, and found it still the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
object of mysterious awe to the people there.<a name="FNanchor_255" id="FNanchor_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> The
resting-place of Michael Scot will never now be
accurately known, but there is every reason to
suppose that it lies not far from that of his birth,
in the sweet Borderland, amid the green hills and
flowing streams of immemorial story.</p>

<p>Here then we leave the life that has been the
subject of our study, and not without the tribute of
a certain envy paid to so happy a fate as that of
Michael Scot. Like another and far greater man,
whose sepulchre also was not known among his
people, Scot died in the fulness of his powers and
fame, while yet his sight was not dim, nor his
natural force abated. He was denied indeed the
entry to those broad kingdoms of knowledge which
later times enjoy, but we may truly think of him as
one who stood in his own day upon a height from
which something of that fair land of promise could
at least be divined, and manfully did his part in
leading the progress of the human mind onward
to those more perfect attainments now within the
reach of every patient scholar.</p>

<p>We may recollect in closing this inquiry that
the <cite>Abbreviatio Avicennae</cite> was published in 1232 at
Melfi. This treatise, though it came in the Latin
version from the hand of Scot, did not fall within
the scope of the publication made so widely in
1230; since the Emperor’s object at that time was
to acquaint the world with the commentaries of
Averroës. The manner in which the <cite>Abbreviatio</cite>
saw the light was somewhat remarkable. Henry of
Colonia was the scholar selected by Frederick for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
the work of transcribing it from the imperial copy.
A regular diploma passed the seals authorising him
to do this work, and from that writ we find that he
completed it at Melfi, on the vigil of St. Laurence
in the house of Master Volmar the imperial physician.<a name="FNanchor_256" id="FNanchor_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a>
We may surely see in these facts a further
likelihood that by this time Scot was already dead.
Another holds his place as court-physician, another
wields his pen, or at least furnishes the copy from
which the world at large first came to know one
of his most important and characteristic works.
May we not take it then, that in ordering this
diploma to be drawn, Frederick desired to show
his concern at hearing he had lost so faithful and
able a servant, and his anxiety that no time should
elapse before the publication of his remaining works?
Thus regarded, the <cite>Abbreviatio</cite> was a wreath laid on
the grave; a tribute to the translator’s memory,
while in itself it was a seal set to the fame of Michael
Scot as in his day the chief exponent of the mighty
Aristotle, and one who by these labours succeeded
in directing for many ages the course of study in
the European Schools.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE LEGEND OF MICHAEL SCOT</span></h2>

<p>Hitherto we have taken little notice of the fame
by which Michael Scot is most widely known in
literature; preferring to speak first of the authentic
facts and real employments of his life, so far as
these can now be ascertained. It would be improper,
however, to close our investigation without
taking some account of that darker reputation
which has so long represented him to the world
as a magician and dealer in forbidden lore. If we
have deferred so long the consideration of this
matter, the reason may be found in the fact that
there seems to be no truth in such stories. They
live only in legend, and in the literature of
romance, and must therefore be held apart by a
firm line from the domain of sober historical inquiry.</p>

<p>This conclusion, be it observed, is not based
upon the prevailing opinion of the present day that
such arts are impossible, nor has it thence been
reached by way of the inference that because magic
is impossible, therefore Michael Scot cannot have
meddled in it. Such was not at all the view held
in the thirteenth century. Then scholars as well
as the unlearned, and clergy as well as laity, believed
firmly in the possibility, nay, the reality, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
what they regarded as an unwarrantable interference
with the order of nature. This belief makes
it a fair subject of discussion in regard to any one
of that age whether or not he may have practised
forbidden arts. The question in Scot’s case is a
highly curious one, and, without further apology,
we now proceed to examine it in detail.</p>

<p>The most famous schools of magic in those days
were fixed by popular tradition in the Spanish cities
of Toledo and Salamanca, especially the former.
Magic, indeed, was generally spoken of as the
<i lang="la">scientia Toletana</i>. The <cite>Morgante Maggiore</cite> of Pulci
may furnish us with a fair example of the common
belief:<a name="FNanchor_257" id="FNanchor_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">‘Per quel ch’io udì gia dir, sendo in Tolleta</div>
<div class="verse">Dove ogni negromante si racozza.’</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and again:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">‘Questa città di Tolleta solea</div>
<div class="verse">Tenere studio di Nigromanzia.</div>
<div class="verse">Quivi di magica arte si legea</div>
<div class="verse">Pubblicamente, e di Piromancia</div>
<div class="verse">E molti Geomanti sempre avea</div>
<div class="verse">E esperimenti assai di Idromanzia.’</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Caesar Von Heisterbach, the anecdote-monger of
the century, relates more than one diverting tale
of necromantic prodigies, the scene of which he lays
at Toledo. The most remarkable of these stories
tells how some Germans came thither to learn
magic.<a name="FNanchor_258" id="FNanchor_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> Their teacher in this art called up certain
spirits, who appeared first as armed men, and then
in the form of lovely maids. One of the students
was thereby allured and carried off. The others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
drew their swords and threatened the master with
death, until, overcome by fear, he used his power
to secure their companion’s return.</p>

<p>From the favourite locality of these legends we
may infer that the magic then in vogue was that
of the Arabs, which, especially in Spain, had now
begun to supplant the ancient and primitive European
superstitions. This magic was not a mere
ritual of spells, such as that of the Chaldean monuments,
but rather a complete theurgy, like the
magic of Egypt; the corruption of an ancient and
elaborate religious system.<a name="FNanchor_259" id="FNanchor_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> The Arabian mage
pretended to bow the superior powers which other
men could only worship, and boldly bade them do
his will. It is hardly necessary to say that such
a system did not originally belong to the Arabs,
who had been, until the days of Mohammed, a rude
and savage people. They learned it in Syria and
Egypt, where the theories of Porphyry and Iamblichus
still held sway.<a name="FNanchor_260" id="FNanchor_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> In their hands this magic
became enriched with many new conceits, such as
the nimble fancy of these children of the East
knew well how to interweave with all that they
touched. The stars, they held, were the centres
of supreme influence, but had certain correspondences
with earthly things; with herbs, with stones,
and even with sounds. These were in a sort the
offspring of heaven, for plants of power were precious
things put forth by the sun and moon; the
minerals were condensed and congealed by the
same heavenly agency in a planetary hour, and
earthly voices, even the cries of dumb animals,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
were but the far echo of the music heard in heaven,
the music of the spheres.</p>

<p>So far, indeed, this was but common doctrine,
shared by all the science of the time, and eminently
expounded in every astrological system. The magic
founded upon it began with the notion that this close
correspondence between heaven and earth might
carry an influence able to react in an upward, contrary,
and unnatural direction. Plants and precious
stones, rightly employed, might prove able to bind
the stellar powers on which all depended. Names
and forms of conjuration might control the superior
spirits which the stars represented. Hence arose
a whole system of magical practice, in which, from
the circle of the sorcerer—a symbol representing
on earth the motion of the upper spheres—the
vapour of mingled herbs and minerals rose to
heaven above the glowing brazier, accompanied by
recited spells. It is curious to notice that when,
after several ages, this essentially Eastern and
theurgic necromancy<a name="FNanchor_261" id="FNanchor_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> gave place to the witchcraft
of the North, with its dark demonolatry, the essential
idea of the Arabian magicians still survived.
Its influence may be traced in the importance
always attached in popular belief to the <em>reversal</em>
of natural practice, as a means of securing supernatural
power and effect. Hence the bizarre details
which crowd the witch trials of the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries: how hags walked backwards,
or <em>withershins</em>, that is, against the course of
the sun, or changed a prayer into a spell by muttering
it in a contrary sense.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>The Arabian magic as understood in Spain
during the thirteenth century is very fully expounded
in a curious work called <cite>Picatrix</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_262" id="FNanchor_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> This
book explains that the fundamental idea of the art
was reaction leading up to transformation or magical
change, adding that this reaction may be seen
in three different regions of being; first among the
elemental spirits themselves, next between these
and matter, and, last, the reaction of one kind of
matter upon another, as in alchemy. The second
of these kinds of reaction admits the influence of
earthly things upon the heavenly spirits, and is
the foundation of that kind of magic which the
<cite>Picatrix</cite> proceeds to expound, in details which are
often much more curious than edifying. This book
has special value as showing the intimate relation
between magic and the ordinary studies of those
times. Aristotle is often quoted in it,<a name="FNanchor_263" id="FNanchor_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> and the position
of necromancy with regard to other branches
of science is clearly defined. It is not hard to see
that, when thus understood, this art must have
allied itself closely with astronomy and astrology
on the one hand, and with alchemy on the other.
In the account given by Bacon of Avicenna’s philosophy,
he says that the third great division of that
author’s works, and one which had never appeared
in Latin, was that devoted to the most hidden parts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
of natural philosophy.<a name="FNanchor_264" id="FNanchor_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> The science of those days
left an acknowledged place for the occult and the
mysterious among its doctrines. This place was
filled by magic, a study forbidden indeed by the
Church, but generally recognised as occupying a
real though secret department among the other
sciences and arts. The tradition we so often meet
with that masters of necromancy actually taught
the art of magic in Toledo, Salamanca, and perhaps
Padua, seems but a reflection in later times of what
was then the genuine belief of European scholars.</p>

<p>There is thus no reason why Michael Scot should
not have devoted himself to what was the subject
of actual and serious study during the times in
which he lived, and especially so in the country
where his chief literary labours were carried on.
Were we to follow the mere likelihood of the case,
his interest in astronomy and alchemy would lead
us to think it very possible he might have studied
an art that was so closely connected with these.
But to change such a possibility into a certainty,
or even a probability, something more convincing
than any <i lang="la">a priori</i> argument must be found. If no
actual proof of Scot’s magical practice be forthcoming
we must be content to leave the matter where we
found it; in the realm of dim and unsubstantial
tradition.<a name="FNanchor_265" id="FNanchor_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>The true criterion here must doubtless be sought
in the evidence furnished by contemporaries regarding
the fact alleged. In the case of Michael
Scot such evidence is forthcoming, but we may say
at once that it proves upon examination to yield
a distinctly negative result. His fame in those
days was such that he is mentioned by several important
writers of his own age, such as Bacon,
Albertus Magnus, and Vincent of Beauvais. None
of these has a word to say of Scot’s reputation as
a necromancer. Some may urge that an argument
from silence is unsatisfactory; but does it not gain
great force from the consideration that two of these
witnesses are decidedly hostile to Scot? Bacon,
especially, seems to have lost no opportunity of
blackening his character. To these men Michael
Scot was a sciolist, a mere pretender to knowledge,
ignorant even of Latin; the very charlatan of the
schools. He was a plagiarist too; one who passed
off the work of another man as his own; nay, darker
than all, he was a heretic, or so Albert would make
him; a philosopher who interpreted and exceeded
the forbidden doctrines of Averroës. Is it not
certain that, if Scot had really practised magic in
spite of the prohibitions of the Church, we should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
have heard of this charge from these active and
bitter detractors? Our conclusion from their silence
is therefore neither far to seek nor hard to defend.
These tales, we must hold, were not current in the
lifetime of Michael Scot, nor for many years after.
They had no foundation in fact, but were the fancies
of the following generation, and thus passed into
the settled tradition which has ever since persistently
associated itself with the philosopher’s
name.</p>

<p>But this conclusion raises another question.
How did such a tradition arise, and what were the
points of attachment to which these stories clung?
The ground for the legend of Michael Scot would
seem to have been prepared by the close connection
between him and his master the Emperor Frederick
<span class="smcapuc">II.</span> Every student of those times knows well the
storm of invective and the weight of calumny which
fell upon that great monarch as the consequence of
his feuds with the See of Rome. He was officially
declared to be no Christian but the mystic Beast
of the Apocalypse, vomiting blasphemies. He was
accused of having produced the apocryphal work
<cite>De Tribus Impostoribus</cite>. His private life became
the subject of grave scandal and repeated censure.
Men were taught to believe that he revelled in a
harem of Saracen beauties, and was addicted to
infamous immorality, as well as to forbidden arts.
These accusations were current, not only in
Frederick’s own lifetime, but long afterwards. They
may be studied at large in the Papal Epistolaries,<a name="FNanchor_266" id="FNanchor_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a>
and a striking example of their current popular
form is found in the following barbarous lines which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
we borrow from an obscure author<a name="FNanchor_267" id="FNanchor_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> who used his
pen in the service of the Guelfs:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">‘Amisit Astrologos, et Magos, et Vates,</div>
<div class="verse">Beelzebub et Ashtaroth proprios Penates,</div>
<div class="verse">Tenebrarum consulens per suos Potestates</div>
<div class="verse">Spreverat Ecclesiam, et mundi Magnates.’</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When we remember that Michael Scot was the man
whom Frederick loved to consult and employ, we
understand what effect this depreciation of the
master’s fame must have had on that of his servant.
If the Emperor made Beelzebub and Ashtaroth his
gods, Scot must soon have been recognised as the
go-between in this infernal business.</p>

<p>Such an impression would naturally be heightened
by the recollection of the years which had been
spent by Michael Scot at Toledo and Cordova. We
have already noticed the dark reputation which
attached to the former of these places. It is only
needful here to add that Scot’s ecclesiastical character
would by no means hinder the unfavourable
inference that must have been drawn from his
lengthened residence in the chief seat of magical
study. St. Giles before his conversion, and Gerbert,
afterwards Pope Sylvester <span class="smcapuc">II.</span>, were commonly reported
to have learned the black art at Toledo. As
to Cordova, the <cite>Picatrix</cite> mentions the discovery of
a magic book in the Church there,<a name="FNanchor_268" id="FNanchor_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> which shows
that the supernatural fame of Toledo attached itself
also to this city.</p>

<p>It is far from improbable that the nature of
Scot’s studies in these places may have inclined
men to believe in the stories told of him as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
necromancer. He spent his time upon Arabic
texts, and, with the fanatical clergy, not to speak
of the common people whom they taught, the Moors
and all their works were accursed. No one could
meddle much with them save at the cost of such
accusations of diabolic dealing. Nor was it merely
the language but also the very subject of Scot’s
studies that was suspicious. Since the days of the
Alexandrian school there had grown up round the
name of Aristotle a strange legend which represented
him as a magician; none other than the great
sorcerer Nectanebus of Egypt, the true father, by
an infamous sleight, of Alexander of Macedon.<a name="FNanchor_269" id="FNanchor_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a></p>

<p>Nectanebus, so the tale ran, was King of Egypt,
and learned in all the magic arts of that mysterious
land. When war threatened he would fill a vessel
with water and float upon it enchanted ships of
clay. Thus could he divine the success or failure
of his country’s arms. One day, however, as he
was busy in this spell, the old gods appeared to
guide the craft he had designed as models of the
hostile fleet. Nectanebus gave up all for lost,
shaved his head, and in the disguise of a philosopher,
fled to Pella in Macedonia, where he lived
by practising the arts of an astrologer and prophet.
Olympias consulted him to know whether she might
hope to give an heir to her husband Philip, then
absent from his capital. Nectanebus bade her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
expect the honour of a visit from Jupiter Ammon
himself, and, dressing in the horns and hieratic
robe proper to the character he assumed, became, by
her whom he seduced, the father of Alexander the
Great. The child was born amid thunder and
lightning, and was soon committed to the care of
Nectanebus who became his tutor: a clear point
of connection with Aristotle, who really filled that
office. One day tutor and pupil walked on the
edge of a cliff, when the philosopher uttered a
prophecy to the effect that Alexander was fated to
kill his own father. The boy, who fancied that
Philip was meant, took the words so ill that he
flung his tutor over the rock, and thus instantly
fulfilled the prediction. This tale can be traced
from its appearance in the Pseudo-Callisthenes
through the series of Byzantine chroniclers—Syncellus,
Glycas, John Malala, and the author of
the <cite>Chronicon Pascale</cite>—to the later romances
where it is repeated and amplified. The whole
Middle Age believed it. Not till the fourteenth
century did a doubt of its truth appear,<a name="FNanchor_270" id="FNanchor_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> and that
it was current in the west of Europe at the time
of which we write appears plainly in the preface to
the <cite>Secreta Secretorum</cite>, which has the following
significant remark, ‘which Alexander is said to
have had two horns.’<a name="FNanchor_271" id="FNanchor_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> The real meaning of the
legend probably lay in a patriotic desire to vindicate
for Egypt, though subdued by Alexander, the
honour of having originated the Greek philosophy.<a name="FNanchor_272" id="FNanchor_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
The thirteenth century, however, knew nothing
of such explanations; cherishing the tale rather on
account of the wild mystery which it breathes. No
wonder then if the labours of Michael Scot as an
exponent of Aristotle gave some force to the popular
idea that he dealt in forbidden arts.</p>

<p>Need we point out that the same may be said
of his fame as a Master in astrology and alchemy?
We have seen how close was the relation in which
these sciences stood to the magic of the day. As
to mathematics, for which Scot was so renowned,
it is to be observed that the kind of divination
called <cite>Geomancy</cite>, which was performed by casting
figures in a box filled with sand, was remarkably like
the method of working sums which is still practised
among the Moors.<a name="FNanchor_273" id="FNanchor_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> We may add that the facility
with which difficult problems could be solved by the
new methods of calculation borrowed from that people
must have seemed little less than supernatural to
those as yet unacquainted with the secrets of algebra.</p>

<p>It seems probable indeed that at least one
starting-point of Michael Scot’s legendary and
romantic fame may be looked for in the very quarter
to which we have just begun to direct our attention.
There is in the author’s possession a manuscript
which promises to throw some light on the obscurity
of this matter.<a name="FNanchor_274" id="FNanchor_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> It consists of sixteen quarto pages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
written on parchment in a hand of the seventeenth
century, and contains a short preface, followed by
two distinct works. One of these professes to be
an Arabic original, and the other a version of the
same in Latin, said to come from the pen of Michael
Scot. The title of the work deserves special attention.
It is as follows: ‘Almuchabola Absegalim
Alkakib Albaon; <i lang="la">i.e.</i> Compendium Magia Innaturalis
Nigrae.’ Now, although the so-called <em>Arabic</em> of the
manuscript quite defies the best efforts of scholarship
to decipher it, this word almuchabola is perfectly
authentic, familiar even, being the common term in
that language for what we call algebra.<a name="FNanchor_275" id="FNanchor_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a></p>

<p>This then seems to afford an actual example of
the way in which the Moorish science of numbers
might be mistaken for something magical. When
we examine the manuscript more closely the
suggestion which its title affords becomes still
stronger. Here and there, amid the strange
characters of an unknown tongue,<a name="FNanchor_276" id="FNanchor_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> are designs of a
curious kind; parallelograms enclosed in bounding
lines of red, and containing erratic figures also in
red, that show luridly against the black background
with which the outlines are filled. The Latin
version explains that these are the signs of the
demons whom the accompanying spells have power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
to summon or dismiss. No one, however, who
compares them with the graphic statements of
mathematical problems in the margin of the <cite>Liber
Abbaci</cite> can fail to be struck with the resemblance.<a name="FNanchor_277" id="FNanchor_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a>
The one book seems, in regard of these figures, but
a degenerate copy of the other, made by some
scribe who did not understand the matter he had
in hand, and who darkened the ground of his
designs to heighten the fancied terrors of the
subject.</p>

<p>It would not be easy to miss the meaning of
this mistake. Michael Scot had probably written
or translated a treatise on algebra. We may
remember how well such a conjecture agrees with
the tone of Pisano’s dedicatory letter to him, in
which he submitted the <cite>Liber Abbaci</cite> to Scot’s
revision, and acknowledged him as a supreme
master in this branch of science. It is difficult to
account for this fame save by supposing the existence
of an unknown work by Michael Scot on the
veritable Almuchabola, of which this pretended
treatise on magic is all that now survives. The
mistake that gave it so corrupted a form could
hardly have been made as late as the seventeenth
century, when such things were well understood.
The manuscript, though dating from that time, is
probably only a copy of one much older. The
preface, indeed, mentions the year 1255 as the
epoch of translation, and, although Michael Scot
had then lain more than twenty years in his grave,
this date would suit well as the birth-hour of a
legend which, though certainly later than Scot’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
own day, had yet made considerable progress in
the popular mind before the close of the century.
This explanation of the matter receives some indirect
support from a remark of Bacon’s. ‘It is to
be noticed,’ he says, ‘that many books are taken
for magical works which are in reality nothing of
the kind, but contain true and worthy wisdom.’<a name="FNanchor_278" id="FNanchor_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a>
He adds that there are several ways of concealing
one’s doctrine from the vulgar, such as the use of
Hebrew, Syriac, and Arabic characters, and the <cite>Ars
Notoria</cite> or shorthand. There is much reason to
think it was in this very way that Michael Scot had
suffered. A mistake like that indicated by Bacon
was probably the real origin of his mysterious
reputation as a magician.</p>

<p>As soon as the mistake had once been made,
and the notion of Scot’s magical powers had fairly
taken possession of the popular mind, it was greatly
reinforced by the association of his name and
memory with the still living and adaptable Arthurian
legend. Alain de l’Isle, who lived as late as 1202,
says that the tales proper to this romantic cycle
were so heartily believed in Brittany that any one
casting doubt upon Arthur’s return would have
been stoned by the people.<a name="FNanchor_279" id="FNanchor_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> From the Trouvères
the legend passed to the Troubadours of the south
of France. When the Normans established themselves
in Sicily, these latter poets, represented, it
is said, by Pietro Vidal, and Rambaldo di Vaqueiras,
carried to this new home of their race the <i lang="la">materia
poetica</i> which had so long engaged the best talents
of France. The religious war which desolated Provence
in the beginning of the thirteenth century<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
completed the dispersion of the Troubadours.
Many found a refuge in Italy and Sicily. They
communicated an emotional impulse which led to
the formation of the Italian language as a means of
literary expression. Through them the inheritance
of the Arthurian tales was secured to the people of
the South, who soon began to localise the chief
incidents of this romantic cycle in the island of
Sicily.<a name="FNanchor_280" id="FNanchor_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a></p>

<p>Gervase of Tilbury tells us that near the town
of Catania lies the burning mountain of Etna, called
by the people <em>Mongibello</em>, and famed among them
as the abode of King Arthur, who, they said, had
lately been seen there. The matter fell out thus.
The Bishop of Catania’s palfrey escaped one day
from his groom, and was lost. The man sought his
charge everywhere, and at last ventured to enter an
opening he perceived in the hollow part of the hill.
Here he found a narrow winding path which led
to a pleasant land within Etna, and to a palace, the
home of Arthur. He entered the palace and found
the King lying on a royal couch. Arthur bade him
welcome, listened to his story, and called for the
steed to be brought that the Bishop might have
his own again. He further told his visitor that,
having been wounded in battle with Modred and
Childeric king of Saxony, he had come to this
retreat that he might heal him of his mortal sickness.
Gervase adds that Arthur, not content with
restoring the horse, paid tithe to the Bishop as
one of the dwellers in his diocese, ‘which was a
wonder to all that heard it.’<a name="FNanchor_281" id="FNanchor_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>Caesar von Heisterbach has the same tale in
his collection, but repeats it with some variations.
In his pages the pleasant land of Avalon, with its
peaceful palace, becomes a dark abode of fire,
answering more nearly to the actual phenomena
of the mountain. Arthur hence issues a dread
summons to the owner of the palfrey, who in this
tale is a Canon of Palermo, bidding him appear in
that infernal region within a fortnight. The churchman
obeys by dying at the time appointed.<a name="FNanchor_282" id="FNanchor_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> The
terror which enters into this form of the story is
even heightened by Stephen of Bourbon when he
comes to repeat it.<a name="FNanchor_283" id="FNanchor_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> On the other hand the easy,
pleasant, semi-pagan tone observed in Gervase of
Tilbury lives again in the French romance of
<cite>Florian and Florete</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_284" id="FNanchor_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> Here we see the kingdom
within Etna before Arthur came thither, and find
it a land of faery, where the King’s sister Morgana
holds her flowery court. The <cite>Fata Morgana</cite>, as
she is called, is still remembered on these southern
coasts. When the mirage appears in the Straits of
Messina, and houses and castles are seen hanging
in thin air, the people call them by the name of that
mysterious princess. They think that the sides of
Etna have become transparent, and that what they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
behold is the realm of faery with the Fata Morgana’s
palace in the midst.</p>

<p>These legends show that Avalon, first dreamed
of in the far North, had by this time been carried
southward to find a new locality under Etna, and
that already the mystic king, who dwelt with his
court in the land of shadows till he should again
return to earth, had taken a firm hold of the
southern fancy. It was but a step more then, and
one very easily taken, when men began to see in
the Princes of the Hohenstaufen, and the chief
figures of their court, the heirs of this legend in
some of its most important features. Frederick
Barbarossa, for example, was commonly said to pass
the ages between death and life in a hollow hill.
The Germans identified this abode with the Kyffhauser,
and expected the Emperor’s return in the
spirit of the tales told of Wodan, Frau Holda, and
Frau Venus, in their national mythology.<a name="FNanchor_285" id="FNanchor_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> It was
even reported that a bold shepherd armed with the
mysterious <em>key-flower</em> had forced the secret, entering
these recesses of the hill and beholding Barbarossa
as in life, with his red beard growing through
the marble table at which he sat asleep. The
romantic heritage next fell upon Barbarossa’s grandson
Frederick <span class="smcapuc">II.</span> It was long before the adherents of
the Empire who had staked so much upon their
great champion’s bold defiance of the Papacy could
bring themselves to believe that he was really dead.
In 1250 his corpse was carried in solemn procession
from Fiorentino, where he died, to Palermo, the
place appointed for his burial. There he soon lay
in the ancient sarcophagus brought from Cefalù;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
his robe embroidered about the hem with Cufic
characters, and the sceptre and apple of empire in
his powerless hands;<a name="FNanchor_286" id="FNanchor_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> but still the Ghibellines could
not give up the hope that one day he would wake
again, and lead them to the victory they looked
for.</p>

<p>This expectation was much strengthened by a
prophecy then current under the name of the Abbot
Joachim. ‘There cometh an Eagle, at whose
appearing the Lion shall be destroyed: yea a young
Eagle who shall make his nest in the den of the
Lion. Of the race of the Eagle shall arise another
Eagle called Frederick. He shall reign indeed, and
shall stretch his wings till they touch the ends of
the earth. In his days shall the chief Pontiff and
his clergy be despoiled and dispersed.’<a name="FNanchor_287" id="FNanchor_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> On the
other side a Guelf poet, whose name we do not
know, associated Frederick <span class="smcapuc">II.</span> with Arthur in the
following lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">‘Cominatur impius, dolens de jacturis</div>
<div class="verse">Cum suo Britonibus Arturo Venturis.’<a name="FNanchor_288" id="FNanchor_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The collection called the <cite>Cento Novelle Antiche</cite>
reflects this myth very plainly; for, in the strange
tales then told of Frederick and his court, we seem
to see these personages already transported to a
kind of fairyland, where the laws of earthly life no
longer hold good. The scene is unmistakably laid
in the Avalon of Arthur and amid his shadowy
court.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the most striking incidents which marked
the long funeral procession of Frederick <span class="smcapuc">II.</span> through
the southern provinces of Italy was furnished by
the grief of a faithful band of Saracens, who, with
dishevelled hair and cries of sorrow, accompanied
the body of their great benefactor to its last resting-place.
It is probable indeed that these people, of
whom Frederick had not a few both in Sicily and
in various colonies on the mainland, may have
joined very heartily with their Christian neighbours
in giving currency to the latest application of the
Arthurian legend. In all essential features it must
already have been familiar to them as a form of
myth long known in the East. Even the romance
of Nectanebus already noticed had a certain historical
basis. In the fourth century before Christ
a king called Nekhtneb reigned in Egypt. He was
defeated by the Persians, and fled into a distant
province of Ethiopia. Thus the ancient national
dynasty of the Pharaohs came to an end, but the
people long refused to believe that their king was
dead. They consulted an oracle, which told them
he would return, as a young man, to conquer the
enemies of his country. This prophecy was engraved
on the base of the royal statue and served
long to sustain the national hope. The same
dreams appeared in connection with the much more
recent Mohammedan power. The <i>Shi’ah</i> and <i>Sunnee</i>
sects of Islam held firmly to the idea that the
twelfth Imam was not really dead, but would return
to earth. This mysterious person was <i>El Mohdy</i>,
the last incarnation of the Deity, as they supposed.
He was said to dwell in a cave near Bagdad, whence
he would one day reappear to oppose <i>Ed Dejal</i>, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
Moslem Antichrist, in a time of great trouble, when
he would overthrow him and his ally the <em>earth-beast</em>
in final conflict near Aleppo. Mohammed himself
was said to have retreated with Abu Bekr to a cave,
where they lay concealed behind a spider’s web, as
the Scottish tale says Bruce did before his decisive
appearance and victory. The influence of these myths
may be seen even during the lifetime of Frederick
<span class="smcapuc">II.</span>, when the extravagant hopes of his followers led
them to use language regarding the Emperor which
was applicable only to the Deity. We may see in
this an anticipation by hyperbole of the apotheosis
granted him by the Ghibellines after his death.<a name="FNanchor_289" id="FNanchor_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a></p>

<p>As for Michael Scot himself, it was a very
natural progress of the popular imagination which
made him play Merlin to the Emperor’s Arthur.
That this place in the growing legend was actually
his, seems probable from the fact that, in the
romance of <cite>Maugis <span class="antiqua">(or Merlin)</span> and Vivien</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_290" id="FNanchor_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> the
hero is made to study his art in Toledo, where Scot
had notoriously been. Mysterious caves, the refuge
of slumbering heroes, were spoken of as existing
both near that city and Salamanca. It may be
that we here touch on the origin of Scot’s legendary
connection with the Eildon Hills in his own borderland.
That the Scottish Avalon lay beneath these
there can be little doubt. Sir Walter Scott repeats
a traditional tale which reminds us unmistakably
of those given by Gervase of Tilbury and Caesar
von Heisterbach. A countryman of Roxburghshire
had sold a horse to an old man of the hills. Payment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
was appointed to be made at midnight, on
Eildon, at a place called the <em>Lucken Howe</em>. When
the coin, which was of ancient and forgotten
mintage, had been duly handed over, the old man
invited the other to view his dwelling. They
passed within the hill, where the stranger was
surprised to see ranks of steeds ready caparisoned:
a silent cavalier in armour standing by the side of
each. ‘These will wake for Shirramuir,’ said his
guide. In the cave hung a sword and a horn.
‘The sound of this horn,’ the old man told him,
‘will break the spell of their slumber.’ The
countryman caught it to his lips and blew a blast.
The horses neighed, pawed the ground, and shook
their trappings, while the knights stirred, and the
place rang again with the sound of their arms. He
dropped the horn in fear, and heard a voice which
said: ‘Woe to him who does not unsheathe the
sword ere he has blown the horn.’ He was then
carried back again to the hillside, and could never
more discover the entrance to that subterranean
realm.<a name="FNanchor_291" id="FNanchor_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a></p>

<p>An English form of the same tale has been preserved,
and is worth notice as containing what
may possibly be a reference to Michael Scot’s
prediction regarding Frederick’s death ‘at the iron
gates.’ The story says that ‘in the neighbourhood
of Macclesfield, on Monk’s Heath, is a small inn
known by the designation of ‘The Iron Gates,’
the sign representing a pair of ponderous gates of
that metal opening at the bidding of a figure
enveloped in a cowl, before whom kneels another,
more resembling a modern yeoman than one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
twelfth or thirteenth century, to which period this
legend is attributed. Behind this person is a white
horse rearing, and in the background a view of
Alderley Edge. The story is thus told of the
tradition to which the sign relates:</p>

<p>‘A farmer from Mobberly was riding on a white
horse over the heath which skirts Alderley Edge.
Of the good qualities of his steed he was justly
proud, and while stooping down to adjust its mane
previously to his offering it for sale at Macclesfield,
he was surprised by the sudden starting of the
animal. On looking up he perceived a figure of
more than common height, enveloped in a cowl, and
extending a staff of black wood across his path.
The figure addressed him in a commanding voice:
told him that he would seek in vain to dispose of
his steed for whom a nobler destiny was in store,
and bade him meet him when the sun was set,
with his horse, at the same place. The farmer,
resolving to put the truth of this prediction to the
test, hastened on to Macclesfield fair, but no purchaser
could be obtained for his horse. In vain he
reduced his price to half; many admired, but no
one was willing to be the possessor of so promising
a steed. Summoning, therefore, all his courage, he
determined to brave the worst, and at sunset
reached the appointed place. The monk was
punctual to his appointment. “Follow me,” said he,
and led the way by the <em>Golden Stone</em>, <em>Stormy Point</em>
to <em>Saddle Bole</em>. On their arrival at this last-named
spot, the neigh of horses seemed to arise
from beneath their feet. The stranger waved his
wand, the earth opened and disclosed a pair of
ponderous iron gates. Terrified at this, the horse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
plunged and threw his rider, who, kneeling at the
feet of his fearful companion, prayed earnestly for
mercy. The monk bade him fear nothing, but
enter the cavern, on each side of which were horses
resembling his own in size and colour. Near these
lay soldiers accoutred in ancient armour, and in the
chasms of the rock were arms and piles of gold and
silver. From one of these the enchanter took the
price of the horse in ancient coin, and on the farmer
asking the meaning of these subterranean armies,
exclaimed: “These are caverned warriors preserved
by the good genius of England, until that
eventful day when, distracted by intestine broils,
England shall be thrice won and lost between sunrise
and sunset. Then we, awakening from our
sleep, shall rise to turn the fate of Britain. This
shall be when George, the son of George, shall reign.
When the forests of Delamare shall wave their arms
over the slaughtered sons of Albion. Then shall the
eagle drink the blood of princes from the headless
cross (query, corse?). Now haste thee home, for it is
not in thy time these things shall be. A Cestrian
shall speak it and be believed.” The farmer left the
cavern, the iron gates closed, and though often
sought for, the place has never again been found.’<a name="FNanchor_292" id="FNanchor_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a></p>

<p>Arthur, the King of Faery, has dropped out of
these legends in the course of their transmission to
modern times, but in another story, told of the
Eildon Hills, his sister, the Fata Morgana, still lives
and reigns; for she is no doubt the <em>Faery Queen</em>
with whom Thomas Rhymer spent so many years
underground ere he returned with the gift of prophetic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
truth. In the Scottish legend, which makes
Michael Scot have much to do in forming these
hills to their present shape, we seem to see him
occupying his natural place in the myth as that
Merlin whose art composed and maintained the
magic kingdom of Avalon, where Arthur sleeps
with Morgana till the hour of his return.</p>

<p>The fertile fancy of these ages ran to the formation
of other points of likeness. Merlin had his
Vivien, who betrayed him to his loss of life and
power by a spell of his own composing. So Michael
was said to have loved a beautiful woman, who,
Delilah-like, left him no peace till he told her the
poison which alone had power over his charmed
life: the broth of a breme sow, of which accordingly
he died, taking it confidently from his false leman’s
hand.<a name="FNanchor_293" id="FNanchor_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> Michael too, like Merlin, had his <cite>Book of
Might</cite>; for the same fancy which materialised
Frederick’s heretical tendencies, and made them
objective in the supposed work <cite>De Tribus Impostoribus</cite>,
soon did the like by those diabolical arts
in which Scot was said to have excelled. It is
possible that some reference to this may have been
intended in the book which is held by the magician
in the S. Maria Novella fresco. The plan of these
paintings in the Spanish chapel at Florence was
drawn out with great care by Fra Jacopo Passavanti,
a learned monk of that convent. He has
left a series of Lenten sermons, collected and enlarged
by himself, and published under the title of
<cite>Lo Specchio di vera Penitenza</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_294" id="FNanchor_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> The last two
chapters of this work are devoted to the reproof of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
magical arts; a subject which the author would
seem to have studied closely. He may have been
influenced in this direction by S. Augustine’s
<cite>De Civitate Dei</cite>, which he translated into Italian.
More than one passage of the <cite>Specchio</cite> may be
cited as illustrating the frescoes of the Spanish
Chapel. He tells us, for example, that the devil
is said to be able to teach science to his
disciples in an incredibly short space of time, however
rude and ignorant they may be. For this
purpose he has given them a book called the <cite>Ars
Notoria</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_295" id="FNanchor_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> the same which is so severely condemned
by Aquinas. Now, as Aquinas, with open book of
heavenly doctrine, is figured in the chief position
on the opposite (north) wall of the chapel, it is no
unreasonable conjecture which finds in the magician’s
book on the south wall a pictorial representation
of the <cite>Ars Notoria</cite> as it was conceived by
Passavanti. Elsewhere in the volume he again
returns to the subject of magical works.<a name="FNanchor_296" id="FNanchor_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> Zoroaster,
he says, first learned the art from demons, and caused
it to be written on two columns, one of marble to
survive the floods, and one of terra-cotta to resist
the fire. This diabolic teaching, thus preserved,
flourished among the Egyptians, Chaldeans,
Persians, Indians, and other Oriental nations who
remained its chief exponents, ‘though perchance,’
adds Passavanti, ‘it may be more studied among
ourselves than we are ready to believe.’<a name="FNanchor_297" id="FNanchor_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
passage may serve to show why the artist of the
Spanish Chapel was directed to draw his Magus in
the fashion of the East, and helps us to understand
the prejudice which Michael Scot’s outlandish costume
must have raised against him. It is in any case
certain that the stories of his supernatural power
became both memorable in substance and rich in

<span class="smaller">THE LEGEND OF MICHAEL SCOT—CONCLUSION</span></h2>

<p>The attachment of Michael Scot to his master, the
Emperor Frederick <span class="smcapuc">II.</span>, may be conceived as acting
in a double sense to procure him his mysterious
fame. With the Guelfs, who bitterly opposed that
great monarch and his followers, it of course became
a reason for believing him to have practised the
blackest of arts. With the Ghibellines, on the
other hand, who formed the imperial party, and
saw a very Arthur in their famous leader, it served
to confirm his character as a Mage and man of
mysterious might.</p>

<p>Commencing then with one of the first, and
certainly the most famous of the authors who have
spoken of Scot in this romantic and legendary
style, the observation just made will enable us to
understand without much difficulty the sense of
Dante’s reference to the magician. The poet
represents himself as reaching the fourth division
of the eighth infernal circle, when Virgil draws
his attention to one of those who suffer there, and
says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">‘Michele Scotto, fù, che veramente</div>
<div class="verse">Delle magiche frode seppe il giuoco.’<a name="FNanchor_298" id="FNanchor_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Dante was a Ghibelline, and must therefore be
supposed to have known well the tradition of commanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
supernatural power woven by his party
about the name of Scot. There is, however, a strong
element of contempt and reproof in his lines, and
this must be explained by a point of view which
was peculiar to himself. The <cite>Commedia</cite>, and
especially the <cite>Inferno</cite>, where this passage occurs, is
nothing if not a retrospect of the past. In it
Dante calls up the mighty dead and subjects them
to review; his principle of judgment being largely,
but by no means solely, drawn from political considerations.
Even more decidedly was it moral,
and thus, while in not a few instances he displays
the working of party-spirit, in others he permits
himself to part altogether with the current Ghibelline
views.</p>

<p>His reference to Michael Scot, then, is undoubtedly
a case of the latter kind. As a seer
whose attention was fixed on the past he was
naturally impatient of those who pretended to
unfold the future. Scot, as the author of prophetical
verses, seemed to Dante a fair object for
censure, as one who had degraded the sacred art
of the bard to serve the purpose of a charlatan.
He placed him with Amphiareus, with Teiresias
and the other diviners, who, because they sought
to pry into the future, appeared to the poet with
their heads turned backward in punishment of
their presumption. An additional proof that this
was in fact the reason for Dante’s harsh dealing
with Scot may be seen in the <cite>Dittamondo</cite> of Fazio
degli Uberti. This poem, composed towards the
end of the fourteenth century, was modelled on the
<cite>Divine Comedy</cite>, and expressly formed to expound
it. Here are the lines which correspond in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
<cite>Dittamondo</cite> to those of Dante relating to Michael
Scot:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">‘In questo tempo che m’odi contare</div>
<div class="verse">Michele Scotto fù, che per sua arte</div>
<div class="verse">Sapeva Simon Mago contraffare,</div>
<div class="verse">E se tu leggerai nelle sue carte</div>
<div class="verse">Le profezie ch’ei fece, troverai</div>
<div class="verse">Vere venire dove sono sparte.’</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Here the reader will observe that the prophetical
writings of Scot are distinctly mentioned, and we
are not left, as by Dante, to infer, merely from the
company in which we find him, the view that was
taken by the poet of his character and fame.</p>

<p>It was to reinforce this unfavourable judgment
based on other grounds that Dante adopted the
legend already popular regarding Scot’s magical
studies. In doing so he gave the matter a turn
which widely separated his version of the tale from
the prevailing Ghibelline stories, told no doubt
with bated breath, but told on the whole to Scot’s
credit. In thus dealing with the legend Dante
made use of a distinction well known to the Arabs,
and now becoming familiar also in the West: that,
namely, which divided the art of magic into the
real and the illusory; called by Eastern magicians
<i>Er Roóhhánee</i> and <i>Es Seémiya</i>.<a name="FNanchor_299" id="FNanchor_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> The former was
noble magic, and acted in power upon high spirits,
subduing them to the magician’s will; being either
white or black according to the purpose that was
sought by their aid. The latter, on the other hand,
produced no real effects whatever on material things,
but moved altogether in the sphere of mind. At
its highest it gave a mastery, which was perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
hypnotic, over the senses of those whom the magician
sought to delude. At its lowest it was the art of
the juggler and his apes, cheating eye and ear by
tricks like those which have survived to form our
modern conjuring entertainments.<a name="FNanchor_300" id="FNanchor_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> Here the apparatus
of the higher magic was still used, but so as
to be degraded and distorted from its original
purpose. The circle now served to secure the
mage, not from the assaults of supernatural beings,
but from the indiscreet approach of too curious
spectators. The brazier with its cloud of dense
and stupifying smoke served to affect the senses
of the subject; the strange sound of recited spells
to impress his imagination; the magic mirror
to fix his attention, till he became the wizard’s
captive and obedient to his every suggestion. This
was the art of <em>glamour</em>, as it used to be called,
which, in one sphere, seemed to change a ruinous
and cobweb-hung hall into a bower of delight; in
another, made visions of distant places and future
times appear in mirrors or crystals; in yet another,
provided the philtres which provoked love, the
ligatures which restrained it, and even dealt in that
accursed spell of <i lang="fr">envoutement</i> which promised to
procure for jealousy and hatred all their wicked
will.</p>

<p>Such then were the <i lang="fr">magiche frode</i> of which
Dante accuses Scot, and it is easy to see that the
sting of the verse lies just here; in the unreality it
attributes to this magician’s art, much as if the
poet had called him in plain prose, ‘no mage, but
a common juggler.’ Resenting Scot’s pose as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
prophet, and persuaded of the futility of such
dreams in comparison with the splendid and enduring
certainties of his own art, Dante used that
gift with cruel force to convey a similar accusation
regarding the romantic fame of the philosopher,
holding him up to the world as no mighty master of
mysterious power, but, in this too, a mere impostor.</p>

<p>The anonymous Florentine, in his comment on
the <cite>Divine Comedy</cite>, softens the matter a little, and
at the same time imports into it a confusion of
thought very difficult to unravel, when he says:
‘This art of magic may be employed in two ways;
for either magicians compose by cunning certain
bodies, all compact of air, which yet appear substantial,
or else they show things having the appearance
of reality but not in truth real, and in
both these ways of working was Michael a great
master.’ There is an attempt here to vindicate for
Scot a higher place than that of the mere charlatan,
but the commentator’s distinction is one not readily
or clearly to be apprehended, and we may greatly
doubt if it ever entered his author’s mind.</p>

<p>The hint thus given was speedily acted upon.
For to it, no doubt, we owe the numerous tales regarding
Michael Scot of which Benvenuto da Imola
and the anonymous Florentine speak. Landino gives
a specimen, as follows. During the philosopher’s
residence in Bologna he used to invite his friends
to dinner, but without making any preparation for
their entertainment. When the hour struck, and
the guests were seated at table, they found it
nevertheless covered with the choicest viands.
Their host would then explain that one dish came
from the royal kitchen at Paris, another from that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
of the English king, and so on with the rest.
Jacopo della Lana repeats the same story, but with
certain variations.<a name="FNanchor_301" id="FNanchor_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> According to this commentator,
Michael Scot always kept the best company,
living in all respects as a gentleman and cavalier.
In his tricks of the table he did not spare even his
own master, but, while choosing his boiled meat
from Paris, and his roasts from London, would
always procure his <i lang="fr">entrées</i> from the King of Sicily’s
provision. The anonymous Florentine adds another
tale to the same purpose, saying that his guests
once asked Scot to show them a new marvel. The
month was January, yet, in spite of the season, he
caused vines with fresh shoots and ripe clusters of
grapes to appear on the table. The company were
bidden each of them to choose a bunch, but their
host warned them not to put forth their hands till
he should give the sign. At the word ‘cut,’ lo,
the grapes disappeared, and the guests found themselves
each with a knife in one hand, and in the
other his neighbours sleeve. Francesco da Buti
adds the significant note, ‘all this was nothing but
a cheat; for they only seemed to feast, and either
did not really do so, or else took the dishes for
something quite other than they really were.’ This
is enough to show that the sense we have given
to Dante’s words is one which found favour in
early times.</p>

<p>Boccaccio, commencing his lectures on Dante in
the Church of San Stefano at Florence in October
1373, proceeded in them no further, unfortunately,
than the seventeenth canto of the <cite>Inferno</cite>, so that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
we are deprived of his notes on the passage which
refers to Michael Scot. In the <cite>Decamerone</cite>, however,
he treats the subject in a passing way; making
a citizen of Bologna speak of the magician’s residence
in that town.<a name="FNanchor_302" id="FNanchor_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> Scot, he said, had performed
many prodigies there, to the delight of sundry
gentlemen his friends, and at their request had,
on his departure, left behind him two scholars, who
kept up fairly the traditions of his art. This seems
to indicate that Boccaccio had in mind the stories
told by the other commentators on Dante, and the
tone of his novel supports the conjecture that he
agreed with the great poet and with Da Buti, in
regarding these prodigies as pertaining to the department
of fictitious magic.</p>

<p>More interesting, perhaps, are the tales which
involve Michael the magician with the fates of his
great master, Frederick II. In the <cite>Paradiso degli
Alberti</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_303" id="FNanchor_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> for example, we read how, at the feast
given by the Emperor to celebrate his coronation at
Rome, which had taken place on November 22, 1220,
the company were entertained by a strange event.
They were just in the act of washing their hands
before sitting down to table in the great hall at
Palermo. The pages were still on foot with ewers
and basins of perfumed water and embroidered
towels, when suddenly Michael Scot appeared with
a companion, both of them dressed in Eastern robes,
and offered to show the guests a marvel. The
weather was oppressively warm, so Frederick asked
him to procure them a shower of rain which might
bring coolness. This the magicians accordingly did,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
raising a great storm, which as suddenly vanished
again at their pleasure. Being required by the
Emperor to name his reward, Scot asked leave to
choose one of the company to be the champion of himself
and his friend against certain enemies of theirs.
This being freely granted, their choice fell on Ulfo,
a German baron. As it seemed to Ulfo, they set
off at once on their expedition, leaving the coasts
of Sicily in two great galleys, and with a mighty
following of armed men. They sailed through the
Gulf of Lyons, and passed by the Pillars of Hercules,
into the unknown and western sea. Here they
found smiling coasts, received a welcome from the
strange people, and joined themselves to the army
of the place; Ulfo taking the supreme command.
Two pitched battles and a successful siege formed
the incidents of the campaign. Ulfo killed the
hostile king, married his lovely daughter, and
reigned in his stead; Michael and his companion
having left to seek other adventures. Of this
marriage sons and daughters were begotten, and
twenty years passed like a dream ere the magicians
returned, and invited their champion to revisit the
Sicilian court. Ulfo went back with them, but
what was his amazement, on entering the palace at
Palermo, to find everything just as it had been at
the moment of their departure so long before; even
the pages were still going the rounds with water
for the hands of the Emperor’s guests. This
prodigy performed, Michael and the other withdrew
and were seen no more, but Ulfo, it is said,
remained ever inconsolable for the lost land of
loveliness and the joys of wedded life he had left
behind for ever in a dream not to be repeated.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
This tale appears also in the <cite>Cento Novelle Antiche</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_304" id="FNanchor_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a>
but in that collection the place of Michael Scot
and his companion is taken by ‘three masters of
necromancy.’</p>

<p>In the <cite>Pseudo Boccaccio</cite><a name="FNanchor_305" id="FNanchor_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> we find another tale,
referring to the later and less happy period of the
imperial fortunes. The scene is laid in Vittoria,
the armed camp which Frederick pitched so long
before the walls of rebellious Parma. The Parmigiani
had made a successful sally, forced the
defences of Vittoria, and were plundering the place.
A poor shoemaker of Parma, who made one of this
expedition, was lucky enough to come upon the
imperial tent itself. Entering, he found a small
barrel, which he caught up and carried back to his
home. On trial it proved to contain excellent wine,
which the shoemaker and his wife drank from day
to day, till at last it occurred to them to wonder
why the supply never came to an end. They
opened the barrel to see, and found within it a
small silver figure of an angel with his foot planted
on a grape, also of silver, from which flowed
constantly the delicious wine they had so long
enjoyed. ‘Now, this was made by magic art,’
continues the commentator, ‘and by necromancy,
and it was Thales, otherwise called Michael Scot,
who contrived it by his skill and power.’ Needless
to add that, by this indiscreet curiosity, the charm
was broken, and the generous wine flowed no longer
to gladden the hearts of the shoemaker and his
wife.</p>

<p>We have thus traced the development of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
legend as far as the close of the fourteenth century.
During the next hundred years no notable addition
seems to have been made to it, nor does it appear
to have attained any further expression of a remarkable
kind in the region of pure literature. But
the fifteenth century had by no means forgotten
Michael Scot, nor the tales that embodied his
mysterious fame. This, in fact, seems to have
been the period when most of the magical works
attributed to the philosopher’s pen were composed,
and commended to the world under the reputation
attaching to so great a name. Such are the spell,
which exists in writing of this age, in the Laurentian
Library of Florence,<a name="FNanchor_306" id="FNanchor_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> the <cite>Geomantia</cite> of the
Munich Library,<a name="FNanchor_307" id="FNanchor_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> and, perhaps, the <cite>Cheiromantia</cite>.
As, however, a tract on at least one of these latter
subjects is attributed to Gerard of Cremona in the
Vatican list,<a name="FNanchor_308" id="FNanchor_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> it is possible there may here have
been only some not unnatural confusion between
two authors who were closely associated in much
of the literary work they accomplished in Spain.</p>

<p>To the sixteenth century belongs the mock-heroic
poem entitled <cite>De Gestis Baldi</cite>, composed by
the famous macaronic writer Teofilo Folengo, who
wrote under the assumed name of Merlin Coccajo.
A considerable passage in this curious production
is devoted to Michael Scot, of whom the poet
speaks in the following terms:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">‘Ecce Michaelis de incantu regula Scoti,</div>
<div class="verse">Qua, post sex formas, cerae fabricatur imago</div>

<div class="verse">Hac, licet obsistant, coguntur amore puellae.</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>Here the legend is not only considerably enriched,
but it has recovered much of its original tone.
Michael Scot again appears rather as the mighty
mage than as the adroit juggler which Dante had
represented him to be. One would say Folengo
had read the spell of Cordova, where a circle similar
to that described by him is actually proposed. The
use of magical images too, on which he insists, is
the very art which the Arabian author of the
<cite>Picatrix</cite> professes to teach.</p>

<p>These then, or such as these, must have been
the ‘old wives’ tales’ spoken of by Dempster, who
says that store of them passed current in his day.<a name="FNanchor_310" id="FNanchor_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a>
He was, like Michael Scot himself, a Scotsman long
resident in Italy, who taught in the universities
of Pisa and Bologna at the commencement of the
seventeenth century:<a name="FNanchor_311" id="FNanchor_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> an origin and situation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
very favourable to the knowledge of these stories,
both in their Italian and Scottish form. That they
had at an early period become part of the romantic
heritage of Scotland seems very certain. An anonymous
author supplies us with the Italian view of
the matter when he says that the great magician
taught the Scots his art to such a degree ‘that
they will not take a step without some magical
practice,’ and adds that he introduced into Scotland
the fashion of ‘white hose, and gowns with the
sleeves sewed together.’<a name="FNanchor_312" id="FNanchor_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a></p>

<p>Perhaps the best known of these Scottish tales
is that which relates how Michael Scot had a
particular spirit as his familiar, and describes the
difficulty he felt in discovering new tasks for his
supernatural servant. Sir Walter Scott says that
this story had made so deep an impression, that in
his day any ancient work of unknown origin was
ascribed by the country people either to Sir William
Wallace, Michael Scot, or the devil himself.<a name="FNanchor_313" id="FNanchor_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> But,
as commonly told, the legend refers to certain
outstanding features of the country which are
natural and not artificial; a fact which may possibly
account for its persistence and survival in
this form and not in the others. Michael is said
to have commanded his spirit to divide Eildon
Hill into three.<a name="FNanchor_314" id="FNanchor_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> The feat was accomplished in a
single night, but, the magician’s instructions being
very precise, and the spirit finding one of the
peaks he had formed greater, and another less
than the mean, accommodated the matter very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
skilfully by transferring what seems like a spadeful
of earth, still visible as a distinct prominence
on the sky-line of the hill. Next night brought
the need for another task, and Michael gave orders
that the river Tweed should be bound in its course
by a curb of stone. The remarkable basaltic dyke
which crosses the bed of the stream near Ednam
is said to have been the result of this command.
On the third night, finding his familiar still keen
for employment, Scot bade him go spin ropes of
sand at the river mouth. This task proved so
difficult as to relieve the magician from further embarrassment.
It is said to be still in progress, and
the successive attempts and failures of the spirit
are pointed out as every tide casts up, or receding,
uncovers, the ever-shifting sands of Berwick bar.</p>

<p>Another Scottish story, borrowed perhaps from
the relations between Michael Scot and Frederick
<span class="smcapuc">II.</span>, and possibly suggested by the philosopher’s
journey in 1230, speaks of a high commission he
once held from the King of Scotland.<a name="FNanchor_315" id="FNanchor_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> Some
Frenchmen, it is said, had commenced pirates,
and had plundered Scottish ships. The King
chose Michael as his ambassador, sending him to
Paris to demand justice and redress. The magician,
however, made none of the ordinary preparations
for so considerable a journey, but opened
his <cite>Book of Might</cite> and read a spell therein;
whereupon his familiar appeared in the form of
a black horse, just as Folengo describes him. In
this shape the demon carried his rider through
the air with incredible speed. When the channel
lay beneath them, he asked Michael what words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
the old wives in Scotland muttered ere they went
to sleep. A less adroit wizard would have simply
repeated the <cite>Paternoster</cite>, and thus furnished the
excuse sought by the demon, who would then
have hurled his rider into the sea. Michael,
however, contented himself by sternly replying;
‘What is that to thee? Mount Diabolus, and
fly;’ and, the demon being thus outwitted and
compelled, they presently arrived in Paris. Finding
the French King unwilling to hear his representations,
Scot asked him to delay giving a final
refusal till he should have heard the horse stamp
three times. At the first hoof-stroke, all the bells
in Paris rang. At the second, three towers in the
palace fell; and the horse had raised his foot to
stamp once more, when the King cried, ‘Hold,’ and
yielded him to do as his cousin of Scotland desired.</p>

<p>A more trivial and domestic tale is that which
relates how Michael met and overcame the Witch
of Falsehope.<a name="FNanchor_316" id="FNanchor_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> He was then residing at Oakwood
Tower, and, hearing much talk of this woman’s
craft, he set forth one day to prove her. The witch
was cunning, and denied that she had any skill in
the black art, but, when Scot absently laid his
staff of power upon the table, she caught it to her
and used it upon him with such effect that he
became a hare; in which shape he was hotly coursed
by his own hounds. Taking refuge in a drain, he
had just time to reverse the spell and resume his
own form before the hunt reached his hiding-place.
Thus Michael returned to Oakwood with a high
impression of his neighbour’s skill and malice, and
fully resolved to have his revenge at the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
opportunity. This occurred next harvest, when,
under pretext of sport, he sent his servant to the
witch’s house to beg some bread for the hounds.
Met with the refusal that was expected, the man
acted upon his master’s instructions by privately
fixing to the door a scroll containing, amid magical
characters, the following rhyme:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">‘Maister Michael Scot’s man</div>
<div class="verse">Socht breid and gat nane.’</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Meanwhile the witch-wife had returned to her
work; which was that of boiling porridge for the
shearers. As soon, however, as Scot’s man had left
the door, she began to run round the fire like one
crazy, repeating as she ran the words of the spell.
In a little the harvesters returned from the field to
their dinner, but, as each passed the enchanted
door, the spell took him, and he joined the dance
within. Meanwhile Michael and his men and dogs
stood not far off on the hill, whence they could
command a full view of what went on. The last to
leave the field was the goodman, who, suspecting
something more than common from the attention
Scot was paying to his house, was too cautious to
enter immediately, as the rest had done. He went
to the window, and through it beheld the orgy, now
become terrible, and in the midst of all his wife,
half dead from compulsion and exhaustion, dragged
around the house and through the fire by the
bewitched servants. Suspecting how matters stood,
he went to Scot, who, relenting, told him how to
remove the spell by entering the house backwards,
and then taking the scroll down from the door.
This he did, and the unearthly dance ceased, but it
was long ere those who had taken part in it forgot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
the power of the magician, or ventured again to
provoke his resentment.</p>

<p>The northern tales had much to say of Michael’s
<cite>Book of Might</cite>, from which he learned his art, and
of his burial-place, where it lay interred with him.
Dempster tells us that, in his boyhood, it used to
be said in Scotland that Scot’s magical works were
still extant, but might not be touched for fear of
the powerful demons that waited on their opening.<a name="FNanchor_317" id="FNanchor_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a>
This form of the legend belongs then to the latter
part of the sixteenth century. In the beginning of
the next age, and precisely in the year 1629, occurred
the traditional visit of Satchells to Burgh-under-Bowness.<a name="FNanchor_318" id="FNanchor_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a>
This author declares that one named
Lancelot Scot showed him in that place something
taken from the works of the mighty magician:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>
<p>It will be observed that Satchells hesitates here
between the title of knighthood which had been
bestowed on Scot for a century past on the authority
of Hector Boëce, and the more authentic dignity of
Master which was really his. He also antedates
the philosopher’s lifetime by more than a hundred
years; so that plainly what we have in these verses
is legend and tradition rather than history.</p>

<p>This is probably the latest appearance in
literature of the old stories concerning Michael Scot
told in the old way. Naudè<a name="FNanchor_319" id="FNanchor_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> and Schmutzer<a name="FNanchor_320" id="FNanchor_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a>
presently came on the scene, in the late seventeenth
and early eighteenth century, with their critical
defences of Scot, all too imperfectly informed regarding
his real reputation. In our own age the
poems of Sir Walter Scott and Rossetti, while
serving to show that so great a name has not been
forgotten, breathe, it is plain, an entirely different
spirit. They are but the romantic and sentimental
revival of tales that the poets and their world had
already ceased to believe.</p>

<p>Changed habits of thought, reaching and affecting
every class of society, make it useless now to
seek in Scotland for any new developments of the
legend of Michael Scot. This is not so certainly
true, however, of the South of Europe; of Italy,
Sicily, and Spain, where he was once a familiar
figure. There the slow progress of education has
left the common people still in possession of much
legendary lore, and even of the living faculty by
which in past ages such tales have been formed.
To ascertain what an Italian story-teller in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
present year of grace would make of the name and
fame of Michael Scot were clearly a curious and
interesting inquiry. It is one which, on actual
trial, has yielded two tales differing considerably
from any hitherto published.<a name="FNanchor_321" id="FNanchor_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> As these are certainly
the very latest additions to the legend, they deserve
a place here at the close of our collection. Freely
rendered into English they run as follows:</p>

<p>‘Mengot was a notable astrologer and magician.
Mengot was his true name,<a name="FNanchor_322" id="FNanchor_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> but he had many
surnames besides; among which was that of Scotto.
This name of Scotto was given him by a princess.
One night the Prince, her husband, happened to
be in a company where the talk turned on the
virtue of women, and the Prince said he would put
his hand in the fire if his wife were not faithful to
him; so sure was he of her virtue. Then spoke
up another of the company, who made light of the
caresses and compliments with which women use
to deceive, and told a tale for the Prince’s warning.
“There was once a man,” said he, “who thought as
you do, dear Prince; for he took his wife for a
pattern of virtue, and would have pledged, not his
hand only, but his very life that she was so. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
happened, however, that he had a friend who knew
of the wizard whom they call Mengot, dwelling
without the Croce Gate of Florence, and having his
house below the ground, closed by a flat stone of
the field so as to be secret. Those who would
inquire of him must pass to the place and cry
‘Mengot! Master Mengot! I seek a favour of thee,
and, if thou tell me true, I shall not stint thy
reward;’ whereupon he doth straightway appear.
This then was what the friend of the too confident
husband did, for he summoned Mengot, and, in
presence of all, said to him: ‘Tell me the truth,
and whether the wife of this gentleman deserves his
confidence or not.’ After some thought, the wizard
replied, ‘Do you wish a true answer, or one made to
please? I should be sorry to hurt the husband’s
feelings.’ When all desired to have the truth,
Mengot told them that the lady in question had
gone to a place in the Via Calzaiuoli where
disguises were arranged, and that she would be
found next day dressed as a servant in the course
of carrying on a vulgar intrigue in the Ghetto.
Now all this was verified; for the wizard told them
even the very house in the Via delle Ceste where she
would be found with her lover, and it proved to be
exactly as he had said.” When this tale was done,
all who heard it cried that Mengot should be
summoned again, to see whether the Princess were
faithful or not. So they called him, as had been
done in the other case, but with the same result;
for here also the Prince’s confidence had been
misplaced, and that in a high degree. Then said
the Princess, between rage and shame, “Hast thou
scotched me this time; but next time I will scotch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
thee.”<a name="FNanchor_323" id="FNanchor_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> She straightway sought a witch, said
to be more powerful than Mengot himself, and,
telling what had happened, promised her gold by
handfuls if she would revenge her on the wizard.
The woman told her to be easy, for she would
arrange the matter. She paid Mengot a visit
as if to take his advice, and, stealing his magic
rod, struck the ground three times, whereupon
Mengot was turned into a hare, and fled from
his habitation. Having foreseen, however, by
his art that such danger might arise, Mengot
had prepared a pool of enchanted water at his
door. Into this he now leaped, and by its
virtue was able to resume his proper form. The
first thing he did was to seek the magic rod, and,
finding it still in his house, he struck the witch on
the head. She became a skinless<a name="FNanchor_324" id="FNanchor_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> cat, and in that
form haunted the guilty Princess for her sins;
while Mengot was ever afterwards distinguished
by the name of Scot.’</p>

<p>The second tale is to this effect:</p>

<p>‘Michael Scotti the wizard was a mighty master
of witchcraft. There came to him one day a young
lady, richly dressed, and wearing a thick veil. She
told him that she wished to become a witch that
she might cast a spell upon the child of a man who
had forsaken her for another woman, now his wife;
for she said that to bewitch this child would be the
best revenge she could have. Michael was willing
to content her; but we must here remark that
wizards and witches gain their power, either at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
birth or as a legacy from some dying person who
has the gift. In either of these cases, when the
wizard or witch takes the form of an animal, both
body and soul are present wherever the form may
appear. If, on the other hand, any one becomes a
witch of her own desire, as in the case before us,
her spirit may move and act under such a form,
but her body lies all the while where she left it.
But to our tale.</p>

<p>‘Michael accordingly took his Magic Book, and
the skin of a cat, and kindling some hempen fibre<a name="FNanchor_325" id="FNanchor_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a>
in an earthen pot, he commenced to read his
spells, which had such effect that the spirit of the
young lady entered into the skin of the cat. In the
form of that animal she then went about her
business, while her body remained still in the chair
where she was sitting. At her return the wizard
read again in his book, whereupon the spirit of the
new-made witch returned to her body as before.
Michael gave her a book of this kind, and the skin
he had used, and every night she turned herself
into a witch, and became so wicked as to cast ill
upon many children, and even on an infant brother
of her own.</p>

<p>‘Thus the sorceress was hardly entered on her
power ere she brought about the death of her
rival’s child, and killed many others, but an end
was presently put to these ill-doings. Her brother,
whom she had bewitched out of jealousy, wasted
away, and the parents were in despair, as none of
the physicians whom they consulted could understand
the case. One morning the child told them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
he had suffered much during the night from a cat,
which leaped upon his bed, howled, and played
the most frightful antics. They then began to
suspect witchcraft, and resolved that the household
should watch during the next night. On the
stroke of twelve a cat was seen coming out of
their daughter’s room. One of the servants gave
chase, and another went into the room, fearing that
the young lady had also been bewitched, and saw
her lying on the bed as cold as marble. The cry
arose that she was killed. The parents, mad with
grief, made after the cat to destroy it, but with
leaps and bounds, it kept them busy all night as if
they had been huntsmen chasing a hare, and all in
vain. As the bells began to sound for matins the
cat ran into the young lady’s room, and the mother,
beating her brow, exclaimed: “she who has bewitched
my son is none other than his sister.”
Rushing into the room they found her, no longer
like a dead body, but all panting from the night-long
chase. Her mother searched all the corners,
and finding the book and earthen pot, bade throw
them into the Arno. They then besought their
daughter to undo the mischief she had wrought
upon her brother, and so many more, and to promise
she would never do the like again; but to nothing
of this would she consent. Then they threw her out
of window in fear and to the breaking of her bones.
The servants came and took her up; laying her on
her bed again; telling her to heal her brother. Not
even in the last moments of life, however, would
she repent. She could not die till Mengot had
read for her a spell of loosing, and on him therefore
she still lay crying. The servants told this to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
her parents, who bade put horses to the carriage
and fetch the wizard, who was presently with
them. First he commanded her to cure her
brother, and then he read for her in his Magic
Book that she might be loosed, and so she died.
But when the skin and earthen pot were cast
away, they sank straight underground. Thus the
witch, who still came back every night to get the
skin, and take the form of a cat, found all her
magic art in vain; for Michael Scotti had taken
her power away.’</p>

<p>‘Desinit in piscem mulier formosa superne!’ To
such vain and trivial conclusions has a reputation,
justly renowned in its own day, been reduced in
ours. Michael Scot, now become a <em>troglodyte</em>, lifts
his head timidly and occasionally from a den in the
Florence fields; he who, while alive, filled Europe
with his fame, and, by his <cite>Averroës</cite>, ruled the
schools of Padua as late as the seventeenth century.
If a remedy is still to be had for this, the fruit of
Guelphic rancour, it must be found in the direction
we have sought to keep throughout these pages:
that of a serious and impartial study of Scot’s life,
and of those labours of his in philosophy and science
which are so really, though remotely, connected
with the intellectual attainments of our own times.</p>

commodum, et voca nomen magistri tui, sic dicens, O talis de
talis (sic) ordine, in magistrum meum datum per majores reges
tuos, te deprecor ut venies in forma benigna ad docendum me in
tali scientia, quia sim probīor omnibus mortalibus docens
ipsam cum magno gaudio, sine aliquo labore, ac omni tedio
derelicto. Veni igitur ex tuorum parte majoris qui regnat per
infinita saecula saeculorum, Amen, fiat, fiat, fiat. His itaque
dictis, ter aspicias versus occidentem, videbis magistrum venire
cum multis discipulis, quem rogabis ut omnes abire jubeat, et
statim recedent: quo facto, ipse magister dicet quam scientiam
audire desideras; tu dices talem, et tunc incipies, memento enim
quia tantum adiscens memoriae commodabis et omnem scientiam
quam habere volueris adisces in termino xxx dierum. Et
quando ipsum de camera abire volueris, plica pannum et reconde,
et statim recedet: et quando ipsum venire volueris, aperi
pannum, et subito ibidem apparebit continuando lectiones. Post
vero terminum xxx dierum, doctus optime in illa scientia evades,
et fac tibi dare ensem tuum, et dic ut vadat, et cum pace recedat.
Debes iterum dicere cum pro alia ipsum invocabis habenda
scientia, quod tibi dicet ad tuum libitum esse paratum. Finis

<p>I have thought it well to give this complete account of these
two remarkable manuscripts not only because they show the
exact place held by the <cite>De animalibus</cite> in the body of commentaries
written by Avicenna, but also on account of the view
they give of the translations made by the early Toledan school.
In this respect they serve in some measure to correct and extend
the conclusions of Jourdain. It is evident, for instance, that
Avendeath did not finish translating the <cite>De Anima</cite>, but only
proceeded in it as far as the end of the fourth part.</p>

<p>Cum rimarer et inquirerem secreta nature ex libris antiquorum
philosophorum qui tractaverunt de natura salium
alluminum et omnium corporum et spirituum minere pertinentium
nullum inveni qui completam dixisset doctrinam. Quedam
tamen utilia extraxi et ea secretis nature adiunxi procedo (?)
quidem brevitati et addendo quae utilia sunt in hac arte que
alkimia nuncupatur. In quo talia continentur Invencio (? Intencio)
causa intentionis et utilitas. Invencio (? Intencio) eius
est tractare de transformatione metallorum secundum quod
hermes dixit parum enim desint marti quod non fiat luna non
desint aliud nisi quod non fiat tanta decoctio in eo sicut luna.
Et notum est quod sicut 7 sunt metalla ita 7 sunt planete et
quodlibet metallum habet suum planetam. Dixerunt ergo philosophi
quod aurum est filius solis Argentum filius lune Aes filius
veneris Argentum vivum filius mercurii stagnum filius jovis
Plumbum filius Saturni Ferrum filius martis. Causa intentionis
est ut ex tali mutatione nobiliora fient metalla. Utilitas quod
habita notitia huius libri qui lumen luminum appellatur transfigurari
possit mars in lunam et venus in solem et constringere
omnes spiritus volantes. Quorum quaedam sunt subtilia et quaedam
volativa. Volant enim sicut sulphur et arsenicum et ex
illis est etiam argentum vivum. Sed primo de salibus loquamur
2º de alluminibus 3º de atramentis, 4º de pulveribus. Salium
autem sunt diversorum specierum scilicet Masse Alcali Rubeum
Armoniacum Nitrum salsum Agrum Allebrot albo et communis.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Primo de sale communi.</span></h5>

<p>Sal autem commune convenientior est omnibus salibus scilicet
marti. Dixit philosophus quod [si] quisquis ipsum prius ipsius
separationem acceperit et quater per atramenta transire fecerit
postea cum ana sui ydragor sublimati in aquam redire fecerit ac
coagulati quod es [sic pro “aes”] cum ipso mirabiliter dealbabit et
isto fit sal tostum quod tali modo fit. ℞ ex eo libram. 1. et pone
in patellam ferream et combure sufficienter et iste est sal tostus.</p>

<p>Sal masse ponit qualiter sal in massam naturaliter redactus
ut gemma Alexandrinus ungarricus Sardonicus et hermoni (?).</p>

<p>Sal autem alkali est nobilior omnibus salibus excepto sali
alebrot facit autem coagulare alios sales. Iste autem sal fit de
herba salsifera que juxta mare complicatis foliis invenitur, sive de
allumine gattivo quod extrahitur de supradicta herba. Salem
autem alkali prius ipsius meram separationem si quis ter per
atramenta transire fecerit et eodem modo de communi masse
armoniaco egerit ipsius quoque in unum redactis iterum per
atramenta transire fecerit ac cum ana sui ydragor in aquam
redire fecerit et coagulaverit quod convertet martem in lunam et
constringet omnes spiritus volantes.</p>

<p>Iste autem sal inter reliquos sales retinet naturam vetetabilitatis
et minere.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">De sale rubeo</span></h5>

<p>Dictis de salibus et eorum virtutibus sequitur de sale rubeo
sive Indico. Dicitur autem Indicum eo quod apportatur de
India est enim durissime odorifere nature rubedine quadam cum
citrinitate participans. Habet autem fortem virtutem super
venerem rubificandam et dando ei colorem bonum. Verum est</p>

<p>8. Sal gema aportatur de Hispania. Sal autem commune
convenientior est omnibus creaturis. Utuntur enim ex eo in
condimentis mundat enim corpora et reddit ea clara propter hoc
dedit eum omnipotens Deus in cognitionem ut per eum omnia
corpora conservarentur in sanitate bona. Dedit enim bestiis
cognoscere eum nedum hominibus. Condiuntur enim omnia
animalia cum eo et dolcan̄tur (? deliciantur) pecudes in eo. Et
scias si sal iste accipiatur in quantitate una et ponatur in sartagine
et comburatur combustione forti quod iste sal appellatur
tostus. Et cum inveneris in arte ista sal tostum accipias ex isto
secundum quod volueris. Verum est quod non inveni ipsum
congruum in hac arte nisi raro. Eius tamen receptō est valde
utilis in talem quia fingitur cum aliis salibus ad purificationem
martis in lunam et est peroptimus.</p>

<p>7. Sal autem alkali est nobilior omnibus salibus excepto sale
tabor vel alebrot. Facit enim coagulare alias sales et iste sal
alcali fit de herba quadam in partibus baldrach coagulat vitrum
et facit ipsum clarum atque currentem (?) mundat corpora albificat
a superfluitatibus terreis ultra modum. Sal autem alkali si
adjungatur cum sale masse et terantur simul et ponantur cum x
partibus aque dulcis et dimittantur bulire usque ad consumptionem
quarti partis et ponatur in vase virtreo ut clarificetur et
cum clarificatum fuerit suaviter coletur et quod purum erit in
aliquo vase mittatur et quod tenerum est abiciatur et dimittatur
usque quo coagulatum fuerit et non operabis cum eo nisi tritum
dissolutus quoniam operacio eius esset inutilis et si admisceris
cum eo aliquantulum salis armoniaci vel boeci vel alebrot erit
operacio eius fortior et convenientior omnibus operationibus.
Dixit enim Abymelech quod sal alkali erit nobilior omnibus salibus
et convenientior in omnibus operationibus excepto sali tabor
vel alebrot. Preterea quod fit ex vegetabilibus unde retinet
naturam minere et vegitabilitatis. Unde solvit vitrum et facit
ipsum coagulari et clarificat ipsum clarificatione bona.</p>

<p>4. De sale indico rubeo. Sal autem rubeum apportatur de
India et id circo vocatur sal indicum. Habet enim fortem
virtutem super venere rubificando ipsum et dando ei colorem
bonum. Verum est quod hoc non facit per se sed cum adjutorio
videlicet cum duabus partibus istius et 3 bus salis alebrot</p>

<p>14. Sal autem armoniacum est magne virtutis quoniam de
stercoribus animalium scilicet camelorum pecudum et asinorum
fit in hunc modum. In quibusdam partibus terre sarracenorum
non habentes ligna etiam ex paupertate lignorum calefaciunt
balneum cum stercoribus predictorum animalium et ille fumus
resolutus ab eis condensatur in balnea et accipitur illa talis
condensatio et teritur et bulitur cum urina puerorum tam diu
quod coagulari incipit et post modum projicitur in peraside et
colatur. Cum isto enim sale fit azurum optimum et fit in hunc
modum. Accipe de sale armoniaco et tere ipsum diligenter et

prima vice in antea erit azurum optimum et quanto plus durabunt
tanto melius erit. Verum est quod alio modo fit azurum quia
invenitur quedam vena terre juxta venam argenti illa terra

<p>9. Sal nitri est plurium specierum. Una species est salis
nitri que apportatur de Alexandria et ille est vere sal nitrum
cum illo vero lavant mulieres sarracenorum pannos lineos et
faciunt eos albissimos ut nix, lavant etiam facies earum et corpora
sua in balneis. Destruit enim pannum faciei lentiginis et albicat
optima albedine. Non extendo sermonem meum in laudes
eius quia non est magne utilitatis in hac arte nec etiam recipitur
in ea quod sciatur. Alia species salis nitri que vere
nitrum salsum appellatur et de eo sunt due maneries. Una
quarum foliatur et altera filatur et depilatur sicut caro porcina
macra et in ea est salsedo cum ponticitate. Dico enim tibi per
Deum omnipotentem quod in eo est tanta virtus et utilitas quod
pauci fuerunt de sapientes (sic) qui eam potuissent cognoscere
quoniam in eo est secretum nature quod nullus stolidus et insipiens
potest cognoscere. Sed qui sapiens est et discretus
extractabit multum circa eum. Ille forte inveniet de quo cor
suum gaudebit. Dixit enim hermes filius Gelbeo cum exaltatus
fuerit sal nitrum salsum et acrum si in vinctum fuerit cum

quod ego credo quia inveni in libris philosophi quod eadem est
virtus jameni cum virtute de pluma et sissi et est eius virtus
modo albatione et retinet colorem cum conjungitur. Si vero
conjungitur cum re alba facit ipsam albam et si conjungitur cum
re rubea facit rubedinem acquiri in ea. Sed quidam dicunt quod
sint idem in genere sed diversi in specie. Et quod alia est species
aluminis jameni alia scissi et alia de pluma. Dicotamen tibi in

ab igne nisi misceretur cum rebus humidis et cum illis
dissolvitur et sicut illuminat pannos ita illuminat martem ut
recipiat forma lune. Et quanto magis mars fuerit illuminatus et
magis depuratus a superfluitatibus terreis et feculentis tanto
efficitur ex eo melior operatio. Illuminat autem secundum quod

<p>Text in the author’s possession.—Ms. in 4to perg. saec. xvi.

<p>Interpretacio et Instruccio pro Discipulis seu Amatoribus Artis
Magice pro iis scilicet ad quorum manus post obitum meum
libellus iste fortuito aliquando perventurus est.</p>

<p>Parvi licet Compendii libellus iste sit, magni tamen momenti
esse eundem experieris. Nam scias velim, Curiose Lector, opus
hoc in Arabica lingua conscriptum esse cuius ego per multos
quidem annos possessor virtutis in eiusdem ob linguae insciciam
ignarus semper permanseram; donec tandem auxilio Rabbi
cuiusdam extraneam hanc linguam optime callentis ad genuinum
verborum sensum, rerumque contentarum noticiam pervenissem.
Quae autem exinde expertus et adeptus sum et tu experiri
adipiscique poteris si vir constans et intrepidus sis moreve
prescripto processeris. Ast cum spiritibus astutissimis et humano
generi infensissimis tibi agendum est: Quare cum previa sane
mentis deliberacione et cautela maxima procedas necesse est.
Quod si vero rem rite tractaveris grandia et mirabilia perpetrare
poteris. Reliqua te opus ipsum satis docebit. Unum hoc ultimatim
te enixe adhortamus ut libellum istum optime custodias,
ne in manus curiose juventutis seu ignorancium hominum
incidat. Siquidem per eius lecturam, nisi more prescripto fiat,
funestissime tragedie orirentur. Quare ipse autor in prima
pagina admonet ut in silencio legatur. Nemo igitur quiscumque
sit absque circulo clara et alto voce insertas Spirituum citaciones
legere presumat nisi miserrimum sui detrimentum et interitum
preceps ruere velit. Quapropter quicquid agis prudenter agas
et respice Finem. Vale. Michael Scotus Prage in Bohemia

Magie Innaturalis Nigre, continens Citaciones et Vincula diversorum
Spirituum.</p>

<p>Primum et maxime necessarium requisitum in experimentis
Magicis Composicio Circuli est. Nam sine eo nemo a malis
Spiritibus tutus foret. Quare Magister ex pelle caprina <i lang="la">i.e.</i>
charta virginea faciat Circulum in latitudine novem pedum ad
quem cum sanguine Columbe scribi debent nomina que videntur
in figura pag. iij. (this refers to the other quire containing the
Arabic original which alone has illustrations). Quodsi vero
illum forcius munire cupis poteris pro lubitu addere plura ex
sanctissimis Dei Nominibus Hebraicis v.g. Elohim Adonai
Zebaoth Agla Jehovah, item nomina iiij Evangelistarum et iiij
Archangelorum et adhuc alia que ex rituali Ecclesiastico sive
aliis libris sat colligas. Secundo habeatur baculus qui abscindatur
Corilo in quem inscindi et cum sanguine columbe inscribi debent
verba et nomina in figura pag. iij indicata. Tereio fiat Mitra
pariter ex pelle capre Alba posterior Nigra et scribantur m. ad
illam cum sanguine columbe nomina que habet figura pag. iiij.
Quarto Magister habeat habitum nigrum longum usque ad pedes
super habitum vero Scapulare sive pentaculum factum ex ante
dicta charta virginea et iterum cum sanguine columbe scribantur
ad illud nomina, uti monstrat figura pag. iv. Proinde omnia
hec predicta requisita debent preparari in novilunio in diebus
Mercurii et Veneris horisque hisce Planetis propriis. Que
autem sint hore Planetarum ex libris Astrologorum satis aliunde
patet. Quinto formetur Sigillum sive titulus characteristicus
illius Spiritus quem citare intendis: debet autem scribi cum
sanguine corvi nigerini ad pellem capre nigre factam et
appendatur ad baculum quoque abscissum corilo erigaturque
ad margines circuli uti docet figura pag. v. Sexto Magister
sive debet esse solus sive si velint esse plures sit numerus
semper impar. Septimo requiritur locus securus absitus et
solitudinarius quod si in domo fiat operacio habeat cubile aptum
versus Orientem et relinquatur sive porta sive fenestra aperta;
nec sint plures in domo persone quam que ad operacionem
pertinent; quare semper melius et securius est ut experimenta
fiant sub celo, in eremis, silvis, pratisque desertis nullorumque
hominum conspectui et auditu obnoxiis. Octavo experimenta
fiant in diebus Mercurii sive Veneris sive in prima hora noctis
sive in sexta post solis occasum; de die autem debent fieri in
ipsissimis horis Planetarum Veneris seu Mercurii. Nono
Magister ante Operacionem bene deliberet quale negocium<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
tractare velit cum spiritibus ne medio experimenti fiat confusio
seu perturbacio. Magistrum itaque oportet esse virum gravem
animosum, qui in lingua et pronunciacione non paciatur defectum.
Socii omnes nec verbum loquantur sed solus Magister cum
spiritibus tractare audeat. Hiis omnibus denique bene preparatis
et ordinatis Magister adhibeat fumigia ex sequentibus
speciebus:</p>

<p>Decimo si Magister rem habet quam Spiritus adimplere
resisterent, accipiat baculum et cum eo feriat eorum Sigilla, sed
si nimium pertinaces forent, appropinquet ea ad carbones cum
quibus fumigatum est, faciat quasi assare et successive ardescere
velit et statim eos obedientes habebit.</p>

<h3>APPENDIX V</h3>

<p>Regesta Vaticana, Tom. xii., fol. 136 vo., epist. 170.</p>

<p>… archiepiscopo Cantuariensi sancte Romane ecclesie
cardinali. De provisione dilecti filii magistri Michaelis Scoti,
cuius eminentis sciencie titulus de ipso testimonium perhibet,
quod inter litteratos alios dono vigeat sciencie singulari patris
intimo cogitantes affectu, pro eo tibi, quod inter ceteros per
orbem sciencia preditos eminenti litteratura et profundioris prerogativa
doctrine coruscas, fiducialiter affectione plena dirigimus
scripta nostra, firmam spem fiduciamque tenentes, quod probos
clericos diligas et delecteris in illis ac per hoc ad providendum
tante sciencie clerico promptus et facilis inveniri debeas per te
(137ro.) ipsum. Quocirca fraternitati tue per apostolica scripta
mandamus, quatinus tam liberaliter quam libenter predicto
magistro infra provinciam tuam auctoritate nostra provideas in
beneficio quod recipiente congruat et deceat providentem, ita
quod ex hoc devocionem et diligenciam tuam in Domino commendare
possimus et nos illud habeamus acceptum qui nollemus
omnino quod dictus magister, qui maioribus dignus esset, gracie
nostre, que reputatur ei debitum, frustraretur effectu, contradictores
autem per censuras ecclesiasticas appellacione remota
compescas. Dat. Lateran. xvii Kal. februar. anno octavo.</p>

<p>This extract, which has not hitherto been fully printed in
any of the authorities (Pressutti, <cite>Regesta Honorii Pape III.</cite> vol. ii.
pp. 194, 258; Bliss, <cite>Calendar of Entries in the Papal Registers</cite>,
vol. i. pp. 94, 97) has reached me from the Vatican just before
going to press. I owe it to the kindness of Monsignor Ehrle,
the Prefect of the Bibliotheca Apostolica, and am glad to reproduce
it here, not only because of the light it throws on the
events mentioned in Chapter viii., but as a testimony to the
opinion then held of Scot’s attainments in science. Incidentally
too, it places beyond question the fact mentioned on p. 14,
namely, that he was in holy orders. With regard to the title<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
of ‘Master,’ here repeated, I may add that this would seem to
have been equivalent among the Regulars to that of ‘Doctor’
among the secular clergy; so that there is a further probability
that Scot belonged to one of the monastic orders. Should any
one still doubt that the ‘M. Scotus’ whom Honorius named for
Cashel is the same person as Michael Scot, this extract may
help to resolve the matter. Honorius evidently held Michael
in the highest esteem, and it will be difficult to find another
M. Scotus so likely to have been preferred by him in the very
same year.</p>

number of days in which the sun completes his circle through the twelve
signs. In this way it is equivalent to <em>Mithras</em>. These gems often bear
the figure of a cock = the sun-bird, not without reference to Æsculapius.

<p><a name="Footnote_66" id="Footnote_66"></a><a href="#FNanchor_66"><span class="label">[66]</span></a> This reminds one of the somewhat similar introduction to the
alchemy of Crates, which speaks of a youth called Rissoures, the scion
of a family of adepts, who made love to a maid-servant of Ephestelios,
chief diviner in the Temple of Serapis at Alexandria, thus inducing her
to steal the book and fly with him. The tradition of discovery is
common to both legends, but the Crates has a colour of worldly passion
and the Sirr-el-Asrar a shade of ascetic practice which agrees admirably
with what we know of the Therapeutae. <em>Crates</em> is probably Democritus.
The Arabic version was due to Khalid ben Yezid, and bears the title of
<em>Kenz el Konouz</em>, or treasure of treasures. It is found in <span class="smcapuc">MS.</span> 440 of
Leyden. In a later chapter we shall recur to this subject with the view
of showing that alchemy as well as physiognomy owed much to the
Therapeutic philosophy.</p>

It is numbered E. vi. 205, and consists of 326 pages. The
<cite>Secreta Secretorum</cite> with the <cite>De Mineralibus</cite> was printed at Venice

1180, while Frederick <span class="smcapuc">I.</span> was Emperor of the West from 1152 to 1190.
This would seem to indicate the twelfth century as the time when these
works of the Pseudo Archelaus were produced. It is curious to notice
that Manuel was the Emperor who suffered defeat by sea at the hands of
George of Antioch the Sicilian admiral (Gibbon, chap. lvi.) This brave
seaman was the same who founded the library of the Martorana in Palermo
(see above, p. 25), and enriched it with the literary spoils of his conquests.
It is highly probable that it was in this way the scholars of Sicily
became acquainted with the Byzantine alchemy.</p>

alchemy. Thus the Paris <span class="smcapuc">MS.</span> 6514 has two treatises, both called <cite>Lumen
Luminum</cite> and both ascribed to Rases. The latter of these, the <cite>Liber
Lumen Luminum et perfecti Magisterii</cite>, is that which has been printed
by Zetzner in the <cite>Theatrum Chemicum</cite>, under the name of Aristotle.
It contains, as we have already observed, the <cite>Liber XII. aquarum</cite> and
other material derived from the <cite>Liber Emanuelis</cite>. The former treatise
bearing the name of the <cite>Liber Lumen Luminum</cite> in the Paris <span class="smcapuc">MS.</span>
(pp. 113-120) is remarkable on account of the words with which it closes:
‘explicit liber autoris invidiosi,’ which Berthelot notes, but does not
attempt to explain. The <cite>Mappa</cite> of the Pseudo-Archelaus mentions the
‘Liber invidiosus’ (‘quia liber iste invidiosus est ab omnibus hominibus’),
but what may be the true reading of the matter is found in the
<cite>Liber Dyabesi</cite> or book of the distillation of the land-tortoise (<span class="smcapuc">MS.</span> Ricc.
p. 4ro.) where these words occur: ‘Omnia ista pondera fuerunt occulta a
philosophis, et dederunt nobis alia pondera … quia fuerunt invidiosi,’
<i lang="la">i.e.</i> unwilling to make public the secrets of their art. In later days the
title <i lang="la">Lumen Luminum</i> is found in use by Raymond Lull and his school.</p>

Halle in 1248. They abused the clergy, the monastic orders and the
Pope, but their preachers exhorted them to pray for the Emperor
Frederick and his son Conrad, <i lang="la">qui perfecti et justi sunt</i>. Among the
Albigenses and Cathari generally the word <i lang="la">perfecti</i> was used in a
technical sense to indicate those who had been received into complete
fellowship as opposed to the <i lang="la">credentes</i> who were still on probation. As
applied therefore to the Emperor and his son it would seem to indicate
at least certain leanings to these opinions on Frederick’s part. This might
explain the action he certainly took in trying to detach the Sicilian
clergy from the see of Rome and to set up a national or imperial church
in which he pretended to the earthly headship.</p>

<cite>Liber Introductorius</cite> on the moon as it is given in the Roman <span class="smcapuc">MS.</span>
(Fondo Vaticano 4087, p. 38ro.). It commences thus: ‘Luna terris
vicinior est omnibus planetis.’ Some passages are curious, as when
Scot says that the moon has her light from the sun and he again
receives his ‘a summo coelo in quo Trinitas residet.’ The heathen,
he adds, used to call the moon Diana, and the sister of the sun,
whom they named Apollo. Her proper figure is that of a virgin with a
torch in either hand whereof the flames are triple to signify the Trinity,
that ‘true light which lighteneth every man that cometh into the world’
(S. John i. 9). ‘Virgil saith of her “tria Virginis ora Dianae,” that is
heavenly, earthly, and infernal. Her power causes hunters to profit
more by night than by day, and the owl and night-hawk sleep all day
that they may follow their prey by night. Such creatures of the night
are hated by the rest and hate them in return. The wolf hates the
sheep, and birds the owl. This last is of use in fowling when they use
a night-hawk. Builders, too, know that wood must be felled in the
wane of the moon or it will warp.’ It ends thus: ‘Explicit Liber quem
edidit micael scotus de signis et ymaginibus celi, qui scriptum (sic) et
exemplatum fuit per me baltasaram condam (quondam) Domini
Dominici in mcccxx de mense Aprilis Deo gratias Amen.’</p>

In that case it would probably be the original from which the two
Italian versions mentioned above were made. Nor is it unlikely he
should have devoted himself to medicine as early as 1212 considering
the nature of the work by Avicenna on which we know he was engaged

aurium et surditatem tollunt, causas febrium omnino extingunt et

Library, xii. 27. p. 48, I find a similar prescription which may have been
given either by Michael Scot or Master Volmar who succeeded him as
court physician. It is as follows: ‘Pulvis Domini Fred. Imperatoris, valens
contra omnium humorum exceptionem et precipue contra fleumaticum
et melanconicum, ex quibus diuturnae infirmitates capitis et stomachi
habent [?] provenire. Valet quippe contra defectum visus et stomachi

of the thirteenth century. The Myrobalans, long discarded from the
Pharmacopœia, were the dried fruits of various species of Phyllanthus
and Terminalia which grow in India. They are still used in native
practice, especially in the preparation of the <em>Bit laban</em>, a remedy in
rheumatic gout prepared by calcining these seeds with the fossil muriate
of soda. See <cite>Asiatic Researches</cite>, xi. pp. 174, 181, 192. The bellirica
and emblica are other species of the same plant, the Terminalia. See
Bauhin’s <cite>Historia Plantarum</cite>, 1613. The Dyagridium or Dacridium
is an alternative name for scammony. Azarum, the same as asarum, the
Aristolochia. Maratum or Marathrum an old name for fennel. Reb. is
probably the Robes of the early chemical authors = a vinegar, here
impregnated with the active principle of the fruits prescribed. Cyminum
= cumin. Calamita = mint. Pulegium = pennyroyal, another of the
mints. Salgemma = rock-salt. We shall become familiar with this
term in perusing the <cite>Liber Luminis</cite> of Michael Scot. Centrumgallus,
according to Du Cange, the common garden cockscomb. Herbia regia,
the Ocymum citrinum or citron basil. Olibanum, frankincense.
Galengha, the root of a species of Alpinia. Regulitia, liquorice. I have
been greatly helped in identifying several of these forgotten simples
by the kindness of Mr. J. M. Shaw, sub-librarian to the Royal College

<p><a name="Footnote_265" id="Footnote_265"></a><a href="#FNanchor_265"><span class="label">[265]</span></a> That the Arabian magic was familiar to Scot, there can, however, be
no manner of doubt. Take, for instance, the following passage from the
<cite>Liber Introductorius</cite> (<span class="smcapuc">MS.</span> Bodl. 266, p. 113): ‘Puteus, qui alio nomine
sacrarius, navigantibus per contrarium eo quod sequitur caudam scorpionis
inter astra, et dicitur poetice quod Dii prius fecerunt in eo con[junctio]nem
et sacrificium, cum esset locus secretus intrinsecus, et locus plenus
spiritibus multe sapientie, a quorum astuciis pauci evadunt, et ipsi sunt
fortiores ceteris ad opera conjuratorum de omni dum con[junctio]ne
removentur obedientes vate (?) et[iam] ante pyromancie. Illos libentius
convocant contra ceteros, et sibi reperiunt in agendo valentiores, set ipsi
sunt multis penis ignis afflicti, et ex hac de causa nigromantici requirunt
studiose Puteum intueri, sive stellas Sacrarii, ut eorum auxilio plenius
operentur optata. Et dicitur a multis quod de illo exeunt lapides et
sagipte tonitruale, opere spirituum inferorum. Cum non sit ymago celi,
habet stellas pervisibiles quatuor, dispositio quarum sic certificatur: in
superfitie flammarum exeuntium sunt duo, et duo parum sub ore puthealis,
et hec est forma in celo aspectus sui.’ Over against this we find the application,
as follows: Natus in hoc signo erit gratiosus habere experimenta
et scire incantationes, constringere spiritus et mirabilia facere, et
mulieres convincere artis ingeniosus erit, quietus, sagax, et plus pauper
quam dives, et uti metallis, et alchemesta, et nigromanticus et erit homo
quietus, ingeniosus, sagax, secretus, debilis, pauidus, timidus, etc.’ The
superstition of which Mirandola accuses Scot is very evident here, but it
is no less plain that the author’s purpose was astrological and not magical.</p>

second time, and then the cry was ‘Prepare a great fire,’ upon which
other voices asked for whom this should be done, and the answer came
back that it was for the Duke of Thuringia, a friend and trusty servant
of these lower powers. This the hearers made faith of in a writing
given to the Emperor Frederick, and it presently appeared that Bertolph
of Thuringia, a noted tyrant, heretic and persecutor of the Church, had
died at the very day and hour when these voices were heard on Etna.</p>

‘Certain people,’ he says (p. 351), ‘have a superstition regarding

who call themselves Egyptians.’ We have hitherto supposed that 1422
was the time when Gipsies first appeared in the West. That year is
cited by Muratori in his <cite>Dissertazioni</cite> as the date of a document which
speaks of the coming of Andrew, who called himself Duke of Egypt, and
all his tribe. Passavanti, however, wrote about 1350, so that the epoch

who procured them for me from an old Florentine woman. She is
familiar to Mr. Leland’s friends as ‘Maddalena,’ and is the depository
of that traditional lore on which he has so happily drawn in his <cite>Legends
of Florence</cite>. Her stories are interesting if only as an example of folklore
up to date, and of the way in which an Italian mind deals with the
legend of Michael Scot, while some points they offer are certainly
original and highly curious.</p>

the other hand Mengot is a genuine early Teutonic name. ‘Et hic
liber finitus est per manus Mengoti Itelbrot, Anno domini mºcccºlxxxv.’

<p class="noc smaller">“One of the most important and complete books on Scottish architecture that
has ever been compiled. Its value to the architect, the archæologist, and the
student of styles is at once apparent. It consists almost exclusively of what may be
called illustrated architectural facts, well digested and arranged, and constituting a
monument of patient research, capable draughtsmanship, and of well-sustained effort,
which do the authors infinite credit.”—<cite>Scotsman.</cite></p>

<p class="noc">“Forty years ago Mr Skene published a small historical work on the Scottish
Highlands which has ever since been appealed to as an authority, but which has long
been out of print. The promise of this youthful effort is amply fulfilled in the three
weighty volumes of his maturer years. As a work of historical research it ought, in
our opinion, to take a very high rank.”—<cite>Times.</cite></p>

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
